<p class="small center">FROM THE PEACE OF NIKIAS TO THE OLYMPIC
FESTIVAL OF OLYMPIAD 90.</p>

<p class="p1">Negotiations for peace during the winter after the
battle of Amphipolis. — Peace called the Peace of Nikias — concluded
in March 421 <small>B.C.</small> Conditions of peace. — Peace
accepted at Sparta by the majority of members of the Peloponnesian
alliance. — The most powerful members of the alliance refuse to
accept the truce — Bœotians, Megarians, Corinthians, and Eleians.
— Position and feelings of the Lacedæmonians — their great anxiety
for peace — their uncertain relations with Argos. — Steps taken
by the Lacedæmonians to execute the peace — Amphipolis is not
restored to Athens — the great allies of Sparta do not accept the
peace. — Separate alliance for mutual defence concluded between
Sparta and Athens. — Terms of the alliance. — Athens restores the
Spartan captives. — Mismanagement of the political interests of
Athens by Nikias and the peace party. — By the terms of the alliance
Athens renounced all the advantages of her position in reference
to the Lacedæmonians — she gained none of those concessions upon
which she calculated, while they gained materially. — Discontent
and remonstrances of the Athenians against Sparta in consequence
of the non-performance of the conditions — they repent of having
given up the captives — excuses of Sparta. — New combinations in
Peloponnesus — suspicion entertained of concert between Sparta
and Athens — Argos stands prominently forward — state of Argos —
aristocratical regiment of one thousand formed in that city. —
The Corinthians prevail upon Argos to stand forward as head of a
new Peloponnesian alliance. — Congress of recusant Peloponnesian
allies at Corinth — the Mantineians join Argos — state of Arcadia —
rivalship of Tegea and Mantineia. — Remonstrances of Lacedæmonian
envoys at the congress at Corinth — redefence of the Corinthians
— pretence of religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[p.
iv]</span> scruple. — The Bœotians and Megarians refuse to break
with Sparta, or to ally themselves with Argos — the Corinthians
hesitate in actually joining Argos. — The Eleians become allies of
Argos — their reasons for doing so — relations with Lepreum — the
Corinthians now join Argos also. — Refusal of Tegea to separate
from Sparta. — The Corinthians are disheartened — their application
through the Bœotians to Athens. — The Lacedæmonians emancipate the
Arcadian subjects of Mantineia — they plant the Brasidean Helots at
Lepreum. — Treatment of the Spartan captives after their liberation
from Athens and return to Sparta — they are disfranchised for a time
and in a qualified manner. — The Athenians recapture Skiônê — put to
death all the adult males. — Political relations in Peloponnesus —
change of ephors at Sparta — the new ephors are hostile to Athens.
— Congress at Sparta — Athenian, Bœotian, and Corinthian deputies,
present — long debates, but no settlement attained of any one of the
disputed points — intrigues of the anti-Athenian ephors — Kleobulus
and Xenarês. — These ephors try to bring about underhand an alliance
between Sparta and Argos, through the Bœotians — the project fails.
— The Lacedæmonians conclude a special alliance with the Bœotians,
thereby violating their alliance with Athens — the Bœotians raze
Panaktum to the ground. — Application from the Argeians to Sparta to
renew the expiring treaty. Project of renewed treaty agreed upon.
Curious stipulation about combat by champions, to keep the question
open about the title to Thyrea. — Lacedæmonian envoys go first to
Bœotia, next to Athens — they find Panaktum demolished — they ask for
the cession of Pylos from Athens. — The envoys are badly received
at Athens — angry feeling against the Lacedæmonians. — Alkibiadês
stands forward as a party-leader. His education and character. —
Great energy and capacity of Alkibiadês in public affairs — his
reckless expenditure — lawless demeanor — unprincipled character,
inspiring suspicion and alarm — military service. — Alkibiadês —
Sokratês — the Sophists. — Conflicting sentiments entertained towards
Alkibiadês — his great energy and capacity. Admiration, fear, hatred,
and jealousy, which he inspires. — Alkibiadês tries to renew the
ancient but interrupted connection of his ancestors with Lacedæmon,
as proxeni. — The Spartans reject his advances — he turns against
them — alters his politics, and becomes their enemy at Athens. — He
tries to bring Athens into alliance with Argos. — He induces the
Argeians to send envoys to Athens — the Argeians eagerly embrace
this opening, and drop their negotiations with Sparta. — Embassy of
the Lacedæmonians to Athens, to press the Athenians not to throw
up the alliance. The envoys are favorably received. — Trick by
which Alkibiadês cheats and disgraces the envoys, and baffles the
Lacedæmonian project. Indignation of the Athenians against Sparta.
— Nikias prevails with the assembly to send himself and others as
envoys to Sparta, in order to clear up the embarrassment. — Failure
of the embassy of Nikias at Sparta — Athens concludes the alliance
with Argos, Elis, and Mantineia. — Conditions of this convention
and alliance. — Complicated relations among the Grecian states as
to treaty and alliance. — Olympic festival of the 90th Olympiad,
July 420 <small>B.C.</small>, its memorable character. — First
appearance of Athens at the Olympic festival since the beginning
of the war. Immense display of Alkibiadês in the chariot-race. —
The Eleians exclude the Spartan sacred legation from this Olympic
festival, in consequence of alleged violation of the Olympic truce. —
Alarm felt at the festival lest the Spartans should come in arms. —
Depressed estimation of Sparta throughout Greece — Herakleia.</p>

  FROM THE PEACE OF NIKIAS TO THE OLYMPIC FESTIVAL OF OLYMPIAD NINETY.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My</span>
last chapter and last volume terminated with the peace called the
Peace of Nikias, concluded in March 421 <small>B.C.</small>, between
Athens and the Spartan confederacy, for fifty years.</p>

<p>This peace—negotiated during the autumn and winter succeeding
the defeat of the Athenians at Amphipolis, wherein both Kleon and
Brasidas were slain—resulted partly from the extraordinary anxiety
of the Spartans to recover their captives who had been taken at
Sphakteria, partly from the discouragement of the Athenians, leading
them to listen to the peace-party who acted with Nikias. The general
principle adopted for the peace was, the restitution by both parties
of what had been acquired by war, yet excluding such places as had
been surrendered by capitulation: according to which reserve the
Athenians, while prevented from recovering Platæa, continued to hold
Nisæa, the harbor of Megara. The Lacedæmonians engaged to restore
Amphipolis to Athens, and to relinquish their connection with the
revolted allies of Athens in Thrace; that is, Argilus, Stageirus,
Akanthus, Skôlus, Olynthus, and Spartôlus. These six cities, however,
were not to be enrolled as allies of Athens unless they chose
voluntarily to become so, but only to pay reg<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_2">[p. 2]</span>ularly to Athens the tribute originally
assessed by Aristeidês, as a sort of recompense for the protection
of the Ægean sea against private war or piracy. Any inhabitant of
Amphipolis or the other cities, who chose to leave them, was at
liberty to do so, and to carry away his property. Farther, the
Lacedæmonians covenanted to restore Panaktum to Athens, together
with all the Athenian prisoners in their possession. As to Skiônê,
Torônê, and Sermylus, the Athenians were declared free to take their
own measures. On their part, they engaged to release all captives
in their hands, either of Sparta or her allies; to restore Pylus,
Kythêra, Methônê, Pteleon, and Atalantê; and to liberate all the
Peloponnesian or Brasidean soldiers now under blockade in Skiônê.</p>

<p>Provision was also made, by special articles, that all Greeks should
have free access to the sacred Pan-Hellenic festivals, either by
land or sea; and that the autonomy of the Delphian temple should be
guaranteed.</p>

<p>The contracting parties swore to abstain in future from all
injury to each other, and to settle by amicable decision any
dispute which might arise.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, it was provided that if any matter should afterwards occur
as having been forgotten, the Athenians and Lacedæmonians might by
mutual consent amend the treaty as they thought fit. So prepared, the
oaths were interchanged between seventeen principal Athenians and as
many principal Lacedæmonians.</p>

<p>Earnestly bent as Sparta herself was upon the peace, and ratified
as it had been by the vote of a majority among her confederates,
still, there was a powerful minority who not only refused their
assent but strenuously protested against its conditions. The
Corinthians were discontented because they did not receive back
Sollium and Anaktorium; the Megarians, because they did not regain
Nisæa; the Bœotians, because Panaktum was to be restored to Athens:
the Eleians also on some other ground which we do not distinctly
know. All of them, moreover, took common offence at the article
which provided that Athens and Sparta might, by mutual consent,
and without consulting the allies, amend the treaty in any way
that they thought proper.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[p.
3]</span> Though the peace was sworn, therefore, the most powerful
members of the Spartan confederacy remained all recusant.</p>

<p>So strong was the interest of the Spartans themselves, however,
that having obtained the favorable vote of the majority, they
resolved to carry the peace through, even at the risk of breaking
up the confederacy. Besides the earnest desire of recovering their
captives from the Athenians, they were farther alarmed by the fact
that their truce for thirty years concluded with Argos was just now
expiring. They had indeed made application to Argos for renewing
it, through Lichas the Spartan proxenus of that city. But the
Argeians had refused, except upon the inadmissible condition that
the border territory of Kynuria should be ceded to them: there was
reason to fear therefore that this new and powerful force might be
thrown into the scale of Athens, if war were allowed to continue.<a
id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, no sooner had the peace been sworn than the Spartans
proceeded to execute its provisions. Lots being drawn to determine
whether Sparta or Athens should be the first to make the cessions
required, the Athenians drew the favorable lot: an advantage so
very great, under the circumstances, that Theophrastus affirmed
Nikias to have gained the point by bribery. There is no ground for
believing such alleged bribery; the rather, as we shall presently
find Nikias gratuitously throwing away most of the benefit which
the lucky lot conferred.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The Spartans began their compliance by forthwith releasing all
the Athenian prisoners in their hands, and despatching Ischagoras
with two other envoys to Amphipolis and the Thracian towns. These
envoys were directed to proclaim the peace as well as to enforce
its observance upon the Thracian towns, and especially to command
Klearidas, the Spartan commander in Amphipolis, that he should
surrender the town to the Athenians. But on arriving in Thrace, these
envoys met with nothing but unanimous opposition: and so energetic
were the remonstrances of the Chalkidians, both in Amphipolis
and out of it, that even Klearidas refused obedience to his own
government, pretending that he was not strong enough to surrender the
place against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[p. 4]</span>
resistance of the Chalkidians. Thus completely baffled, the envoys
returned to Sparta, whither Klearidas thought it prudent to accompany
them, partly to explain his own conduct, partly in hopes of being
able to procure some modification of the terms. But he found this
impossible, and he was sent back to Amphipolis with peremptory orders
to surrender the place to the Athenians, if it could possibly be
done; if that should prove beyond his force, then to come away, and
bring home every Peloponnesian soldier in the garrison. Perhaps the
surrender was really impracticable to a force no greater than that
which Klearidas commanded, since the reluctance of the population
was doubtless obstinate. At any rate, he represented it to be
impracticable: the troops accordingly came home, but the Athenians
still remained excluded from Amphipolis, and all the stipulations of
the peace respecting the Thracian towns remained unperformed. Nor
was this all. The envoys from the recusant minority (Corinthians and
others), after having gone home for instructions, had now come back
to Sparta with increased repugnance and protest against the injustice
of the peace, so that all the efforts of the Spartans to bring them
to compliance were fruitless.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5"
class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The latter were now in serious embarrassment. Not having executed
their portion of the treaty, they could not demand that Athens should
execute hers: and they were threatened with the double misfortune of
forfeiting the confidence of their allies without acquiring any one
of the advantages of the treaty. In this dilemma they determined to
enter into closer relations, and separate relations, with Athens,
at all hazard of offending their allies. Of the enmity of Argos,
if unaided by Athens, they had little apprehension; while the
moment was now favorable for alliance with Athens, from the decided
pacific tendencies reigning on both sides, as well as from the
known philo-Laconian sentiment of the leaders Nikias and Lachês.
The Athenian envoys had remained at Sparta ever since the swearing
of the peace, awaiting the fulfilment of the conditions; Nikias
or Lachês, one or both, being very probably among them. When they
saw that Sparta was unable to fulfil her bond, so that the treaty
seemed likely to be cancelled, they would doubtless encourage, and
per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[p. 5]</span>haps may even
have suggested, the idea of a separate alliance between Sparta and
Athens, as the only expedient for covering the deficiency; promising
that under that alliance the Spartan captives should be restored.
Accordingly, a treaty was concluded between the two, for fifty
years; not merely of peace, but of defensive alliance. Each party
pledged itself to assist in repelling any invaders of the territory
of the other, to treat them as enemies, and not to conclude peace
with them without the consent of the other. This was the single
provision of the alliance, with one addition, however, of no mean
importance, for the security of Lacedæmon. The Athenians engaged
to lend their best and most energetic aid in putting down any
rising of the Helots which might occur in Laconia. Such a provision
indicates powerfully the uneasiness felt by the Lacedæmonians
respecting their serf-population: but at the present moment it was
of peculiar value to them, since it bound the Athenians to restrain,
if not to withdraw, the Messenian garrison of Pylos, planted there
by themselves for the express purpose of provoking the Helots to
revolt.</p>

<p>An alliance with stipulations so few and simple took no long
time to discuss. It was concluded very speedily after the return
of the envoys from Amphipolis, probably not more than a month or
two after the former peace. It was sworn to by the same individuals
on both sides; with similar declaration that the oath should be
annually renewed, and also with similar proviso that Sparta and
Athens might by mutual consent either enlarge or contract the terms,
without violating the oath.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6"
class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Moreover, the treaty was directed to be
inscribed on two columns: one to be set up in the temple of Apollo
at Amyklæ, the other in the temple of Athênê, in the acropolis of
Athens.</p>

<p>The most important result of this new alliance was something<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[p. 6]</span> not specified in its
provisions, but understood, we may be well assured, between the
Spartan ephors and Nikias at the time when it was concluded. All the
Spartan captives at Athens were forthwith restored.<a id="FNanchor_7"
href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Nothing can demonstrate more powerfully the pacific and
acquiescent feeling now reigning at Athens, as well as the strong
philo-Laconian inclinations of her leading men (at this moment
Alkibiadês was competing with Nikias for the favor of Sparta, as
will be stated presently), than the terms of this alliance, which
bound Athens to assist in keeping down the Helots, and the still more
important after-proceeding, of restoring the Spartan captives. Athens
thus parted irrevocably with her best card, and promised to renounce
her second best, without obtaining the smallest equivalent beyond
what was contained in the oath of Sparta to become her ally. For the
last three years and a half, ever since the capture of Sphakteria,
the possession of these captives had placed her in a position of
decided advantage in regard to her chief enemy; advantage, however,
which had to a certain extent been countervailed by subsequent
losses. This state of things was fairly enough represented by the
treaty of peace deliberately discussed during the winter, and sworn
to at the commencement of spring, whereby a string of concessions,
reciprocal and balancing, had been imposed on both parties. Moreover,
Athens had been lucky enough in drawing lots to find herself enabled
to wait for the actual fulfilment of such concessions by the
Spartans, before she consummated her own. Now the Spartans had not
as yet realized any one of their promised concessions: nay, more; in
trying to do so, they had displayed such a want either of power or
of will, as made it plain, that nothing short of the most stringent
necessity would convert their promises into realities. Yet, under
these marked indications, Nikias persuades his countrymen to conclude
a second treaty which practically annuls the first, and which insures
to the Spartans gratuitously all the main benefits of the first, with
little or none of the correlative sacrifices. The alliance of Sparta
could hardly be said to count as a consideration: for that alliance
was at this moment, under the uncertain relations with Argos,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[p. 7]</span> not less valuable to
Sparta herself than to Athens. There can be little doubt that, if
the game of Athens had now been played with prudence, she might have
recovered Amphipolis in exchange for the captives: for the inability
of Klearidas to make over the place, even if we grant it to have
been a real fact and not merely simulated, might have been removed
by decisive coöperation on the part of Sparta with an Athenian
armament sent to occupy the place. In fact, that which Athens was now
induced to grant was precisely the original proposition transmitted
to her by the Lacedæmonians four years before, when the hoplites
were first inclosed in Sphakteria, but before the actual capture.
They then tendered no equivalent, but merely said, through their
envoys, “Give us the men in the island, and accept in exchange peace,
together with our alliance.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a> At that moment there were some plausible
reasons in favor of granting the proposition: but even then, the
case of Kleon against it was also plausible and powerful, when he
contended that Athens was entitled to make a better bargain. But
<i>now</i>, there were no reasons in its favor, and a strong concurrence
of reasons against it. Alliance with the Spartans was of no great
value to Athens: peace was of material importance to her; but
peace had been already sworn to on both sides, after deliberate
discussion, and required now only to be carried into execution. That
equal reciprocity of concession, which presented the best chance of
permanent result, had been agreed on; and fortune had procured for
her the privilege of receiving the purchase-money before she handed
over the goods. Why renounce so advantageous a position, accepting
in exchange a hollow and barren alliance, under the obligation of
handing over her most precious merchandise upon credit, and upon
credit as delusive in promise as it afterwards proved unproductive
in reality? The alliance, in fact, prevented the peace from being
fulfilled: it became, as Thucydidês himself<a id="FNanchor_9"
href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> admits, no peace, but a
simple suspension of direct hostilities.</p>

<p>Thucydidês states on more than one occasion, and it was the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[p. 8]</span> sentiment of Nikias
himself, that at the moment of concluding the peace which bears his
name, the position of Sparta was one of disadvantage and dishonor
in reference to Athens;<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10"
class="fnanchor">[10]</a> alluding chiefly to the captives in the
hands of the latter; for as to other matters, the defeats of Delium
and Amphipolis, with the serious losses in Thrace, would more than
countervail the acquisitions of Nisæa, Pylus, Kythêra, and Methônê.
Yet so inconsiderate and short-sighted were the philo-Laconian
leanings of Nikias and the men who now commanded confidence at
Athens, that they threw away this advantage, suffered Athens to be
cheated of all those hopes which they had themselves held out as the
inducement for peace, and nevertheless yielded gratuitously to Sparta
all the main points which she desired. Most certainly there was never
any public recommendation of Kleon, as far as our information goes,
so ruinously impolitic as this alliance with Sparta and surrender
of the captives, wherein both Nikias and Alkibiadês concurred.
Probably the Spartan ephors amused Nikias, and he amused the Athenian
assembly, with fallacious assurances of certain obedience in Thrace,
under alleged peremptory orders given to Klearidas. And now that
the vehement leather-dresser, with his criminative eloquence, had
passed away, replaced only by an inferior successor, the lamp-maker<a
id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Hyperbolus, and leaving the Athenian public under the undisputed
guidance of citizens eminent for birth and station, descended from
gods and heroes, there remained no one to expose effectively the
futility of such assurances, or to enforce the lesson of simple and
obvious prudence: “Wait, as you are entitled to wait, until the
Spartans have performed the onerous part of their bargain, before
you perform the onerous part of yours. Or, if you choose to relax in
regard to some of the concessions which they have sworn to make, at
any rate stick to the capital point of all, and lay before them the
peremptory alternative—Amphipolis in exchange for the captives.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[p. 9]</span></p>

<p>The Athenians were not long in finding out how completely they
had forfeited the advantage of their position, and their chief
means of enforcement, by giving up the captives; which imparted a
freedom of action to Sparta such as she had never enjoyed since
the first blockade of Sphakteria. Yet it seems that under the
present ephors Sparta was not guilty of any deliberate or positive
act which could be called a breach of faith. She gave orders to
Klearidas to surrender Amphipolis if he could; if not, to evacuate
it, and bring the Peloponnesian troops home. Of course, the place
was not surrendered to the Athenians, but evacuated; and she then
considered that she had discharged her duty to Athens, as far as
Amphipolis was concerned, though she had sworn to restore it, and her
oath remained unperformed.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12"
class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The other Thracian towns were equally
deaf to her persuasions, and equally obstinate in their hostility
to Athens. So also were the Bœotians, Corinthians, Megarians, and
Eleians: but the Bœotians, while refusing to become parties to
the truce along with Sparta, concluded for themselves a separate
convention or armistice with Athens, terminable at ten days’
notice on either side.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13"
class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In this state of things, though ostensible relations of peace and
free reciprocity of intercourse between Athens and Peloponnesus were
established, the discontent of the Athenians, and the remonstrances
of their envoys at Sparta, soon became serious. The Lacedæmonians
had sworn for themselves and their allies, yet the most powerful
among these allies, and those whose enmity was most important
to Athens, continued still recusant. Neither Panaktum, nor the
Athenian prisoners in Bœotia, were yet restored to Athens; nor had
the Thracian cities yet submitted to the peace. In reply to the
remonstrances of the Athenian envoys, the Lacedæmonians affirmed
that they had already surrendered all the Athenian prisoners in
their own hands, and had withdrawn their troops from Thrace,
which was, they said, all the intervention in their power, since
they were not masters of Amphipolis, nor capable of constraining
the Thracian cities against their will. As to the Bœotians and
Corinthians, the Lacedæmonians went so<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_10">[p. 10]</span> far as to profess readiness to take
arms along with Athens,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14"
class="fnanchor">[14]</a> for the purpose of constraining them to
accept the peace, and even spoke about naming a day, after which
these recusant states should be proclaimed as joint enemies, both
by Sparta and Athens. But their propositions were always confined
to vague words, nor would they consent to bind themselves by any
written or peremptory instrument. Nevertheless, so great was their
confidence either in the sufficiency of these assurances, or in the
facility of Nikias, that they ventured to require from Athens the
surrender of Pylus, or at least the withdrawal of the Messenian
garrison with the Helot deserters from that place, leaving in it none
but native Athenian soldiers, until farther progress should be made
in the peace. But the feeling of the Athenians was now seriously
altered, and they received this demand with marked coldness. None
of the stipulations of the treaty in their favor had yet been
performed, none even seemed in course of being performed: so that
they now began to suspect Sparta of dishonesty and deceit, and
deeply regretted their inconsiderate surrender of the captives.<a
id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Their
remonstrances at Sparta, often repeated during the course of the
summer, produced no positive effect: nevertheless, they suffered
themselves to be persuaded to remove the Messenians and Helots from
Pylus to Kephallenia, replacing them by an Athenian garrison.<a
id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The Athenians had doubtless good reason to complain of Sparta. But
the persons of whom they had still better reason to complain, were
Nikias and their own philo-Laconian leaders; who had first accepted
from Sparta promises doubtful as to execution, and next—though
favored by the lot in regard to priority of cession, and thus
acquiring proof that Sparta either would not or could not perform her
promises—renounced all these advantages, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_11">[p. 11]</span> procured for Sparta almost gratuitously
the only boon for which she seriously cared. The many critics on
Grecian history, who think no term too harsh for the demagogue Kleon,
ought in fairness to contrast his political counsel with that of his
rivals, and see which of the two betokens greater forethought in the
management of the foreign relations of Athens. Amphipolis had been
once lost by the improvident watch of Thucydidês and Euklês: it was
now again lost by the improvident concessions of Nikias.</p>

<p>So much was the Peloponnesian alliance unhinged by the number of
states which had refused the peace, and so greatly was the ascendency
of Sparta for the time impaired, that new combinations were now
springing up in the peninsula. It has already been mentioned that
the truce between Argos and Sparta was just now expiring: Argos
therefore was free, with her old pretensions to the headship of
Peloponnesus, backed by an undiminished fulness of wealth, power, and
population. Having taken no direct part in the late exhausting war,
she had even earned money by lending occasional aid on both sides;<a
id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
while her military force was just now farther strengthened by a
step of very considerable importance. She had recently set apart a
body of a thousand select hoplites, composed of young men of wealth
and station, to receive constant military training at the public
expense, and to be enrolled as a separate regiment by themselves,
apart from the other citizens.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18"
class="fnanchor">[18]</a> To a democratical government like Argos,
such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[p. 12]</span> an institution
was internally dangerous, and pregnant with mischief, which will be
hereafter described. But at the present moment, the democratical
leaders of Argos seem to have thought only of the foreign relations
of their city, now that her truce with Sparta was expiring, and
that the disorganized state of the Spartan confederacy opened new
chances to her ambition of regaining something like headship in
Peloponnesus.</p>

<p>The discontent of the recusant Peloponnesian allies was now
inducing them to turn their attention towards Argos as a new chief.
They had mistrusted Sparta, even before the peace, well knowing
that she had separate interests from the confederacy, arising from
desire to get back her captives: in the terms of peace, it seemed
as if Sparta and Athens alone were regarded, the interests of the
remaining allies, especially those in Thrace, being put out of
sight. Moreover, that article in the treaty of peace whereby it was
provided that Athens and Sparta might by mutual consent add or strike
out any article that they chose, without consulting the allies,
excited general alarm, as if Sparta were meditating some treason in
conjunction with Athens against the confederacy.<a id="FNanchor_19"
href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> And the alarm, once
roused, was still farther aggravated by the separate treaty of
alliance between Sparta and Athens, which followed so closely
afterwards, as well as by the restoration of the Spartan captives.</p>

<p>Such general displeasure among the Peloponnesian states at the
unexpected combination of Athenians and Lacedæmonians, strengthened
in the case of each particular state by private interests of its own,
first manifested itself openly through the Corinthians. On retiring
from the conferences at Sparta,—where the recent alliance between
the Athenians and Spartans had just been made known, and where the
latter had vainly endeavored to prevail upon their allies to accept
the peace,—the Corinthians went straight to Argos to communicate
what had passed, and to solicit interference. They suggested to the
leading men in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[p. 13]</span>
city, that it was now the duty of Argos to step forward as saviour
of Peloponnesus, which the Lacedæmonians were openly betraying to
the common enemy, and to invite for that purpose, into alliance for
reciprocal defence, every autonomous Hellenic state which would
bind itself to give and receive amicable satisfaction in all points
of difference. They affirmed that many cities, from hatred of
Sparta, would gladly comply with such invitation; especially if a
board of commissioners in small number were named, with full powers
to admit all suitable applicants; so that, in case of rejection,
there might at least be no exposure before the public assembly
in the Argeian democracy. This suggestion—privately made by the
Corinthians, who returned home immediately afterwards—was eagerly
adopted both by leaders and people at Argos, as promising to realize
their long-cherished pretensions to headship. Twelve commissioners
were accordingly appointed, with power to admit any new allies whom
they might think eligible, except Athens and Sparta. With either of
those two cities, no treaty was allowed without the formal sanction
of the public assembly.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20"
class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Corinthians, though they had been the first
to set the Argeians in motion, nevertheless thought it right,
before enrolling themselves publicly in the new alliance, to
invite a congress of Peloponnesian malcontents to Corinth. It was
the Mantineians who made the first application to Argos under
the notice just issued. And here we are admitted to a partial
view of the relations among the secondary and interior states of
Peloponnesus. Mantineia and Tegea, being conterminous as well as
the two most considerable states in Arcadia, were in perpetual
rivalry, which had shown itself only a year and a half before in a
bloody but indecisive battle.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21"
class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Tegea, situated on the frontiers of
Laconia, and oligarchically governed, was tenaciously attached
to Sparta: while for that very reason, as well as from the
democratical character of her government, Mantineia was less so,
though she was still enrolled in and acted as a member of the
Peloponnesian confederacy. She had recently conquered for herself<a
id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
a little empire in her own neighborhood, composed of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[p. 14]</span> village districts in
Arcadia, reckoned as her subject allies, and comrades in her ranks
at the last battle with Tegea. This conquest had been made even
during the continuance of the war with Athens; a period when the
lesser states of Peloponnesus generally, and even subject-states
as against their own imperial states, were under the guarantee of
the confederacy, to which they were required to render their unpaid
service against the common enemy; so that she was apprehensive of
Lacedæmonian interference at the request and for the emancipation of
these subjects, who lay, moreover, near to the borders of Laconia.
Such interference would probably have been invoked earlier; only
that Sparta had been under pressing embarrassments—and farther, had
assembled no general muster of the confederacy against Athens—ever
since the disaster in Sphakteria. But now she had her hands free,
together with a good pretext as well as motive for interference.</p>

<p>To maintain the autonomy of all the little states, and prevent
any of them from being mediatized or grouped into aggregations
under the ascendency of the greater, had been the general policy of
Sparta; especially since her own influence as general leader was
increased by insuring to every lesser state a substantive vote at the
meetings of the confederacy.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23"
class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Moreover, the rivalry of Tegea would
probably operate here as an auxiliary motive against Mantineia.
Under such apprehensions, the Mantineians hastened to court the
alliance and protection of Argos, with whom they enjoyed the
additional sympathy of a common democracy. Such revolt from Sparta<a
id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
(for so it was considered) excited great sensation throughout
Peloponnesus, together with considerable disposition, amidst the
discontent then prevalent, to follow the example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[p. 15]</span></p>

<p>In particular, it contributed much to enhance the importance
of the congress at Corinth; whither the Lacedæmonians thought it
necessary to send special envoys to counteract the intrigues going
on against them. Their envoy addressed to the Corinthians strenuous
remonstrance, and even reproach, for the leading part which they
had taken in stirring up dissension among the old confederates,
and organizing a new confederacy under the presidency of Argos.
“They (the Corinthians) were thus aggravating the original guilt
and perjury which they had committed by setting at nought the
formal vote of a majority of the confederacy, and refusing to
accept the peace,—for it was the sworn and fundamental maxim of the
confederacy, that the decision of the majority should be binding
on all, except in such cases as involved some offence to gods or
heroes.” Encouraged by the presence of many sympathizing deputies,
Bœotian, Megarian, Chalkidian from Thrace,<a id="FNanchor_25"
href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> etc., the Corinthians
replied with firmness. But they did not think it good policy to
proclaim their real ground for rejecting the peace, namely, that
it had not procured for themselves the restoration of Sollium and
Anaktorium: since, first, this was a question in which their allies
present had no interest; next, it did not furnish any valid excuse
for their resistance to the vote of the majority. Accordingly, they
took their stand upon a pretence at once generous and religious;
upon that reserve for religious scruples, which the Lacedæmonian
envoy had himself admitted, and which of course was to be construed
by each member with reference to his own pious feeling. “It <i>was</i> a
religious impediment (the Corinthians contended) which prevented us
from acceding to the peace with Athens, notwithstanding the vote of
the majority; for we had previously exchanged oaths, ourselves apart
from the confederacy, with the Chalkidians of Thrace at the time
when they revolted from Athens: and we should have infringed those
separate oaths, had we accepted a treaty of peace in which these
Chalkidians were abandoned. As for alliance with Argos, we consider
ourselves free to adopt any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p.
16]</span> resolution which we may deem suitable, after consultation
with our friends here present.” With this unsatisfactory answer the
Lacedæmonian envoys were compelled to return home. Yet some Argeian
envoys, who were also present in the assembly for the purpose of
urging the Corinthians to realize forthwith the hopes of alliance
which they had held out to Argos, were still unable on their side
to obtain a decided affirmative, being requested to come again
at the next conference.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26"
class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Though the Corinthians had themselves originated the idea of
the new Argeian confederacy and compromised Argos in an open
proclamation, yet they now hesitated about the execution of their
own scheme. They were restrained in part doubtless by the bitterness
of Lacedæmonian reproof; for the open consummation of this revolt,
apart from its grave political consequences, shocked a train of very
old feelings; but still more by the discovery that their friends,
who agreed with them in rejecting the peace, decidedly refused
all open revolt from Sparta and all alliance with Argos. In this
category were the Bœotians and Megarians. Both of these states—left
to their own impression and judgment by the Lacedæmonians, who did
not address to them any distinct appeal as they had done to the
Corinthians—spontaneously turned away from Argos, not less from
aversion towards the Argeian democracy than from sympathy with
the oligarchy at Sparta:<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27"
class="fnanchor">[27]</a> they were linked together by<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[p. 17]</span> communion of interest,
not merely as being both neighbors and intense enemies of Attica,
but as each having a body of democratical exiles who might perhaps
find encouragement at Argos. Discouraged by the resistance of these
two important allies, the Corinthians hung back from visiting Argos,
until they were pushed forward by a new accidental impulse, the
application of the Eleians; who, eagerly embracing the new project,
sent envoys first to conclude alliance with the Corinthians, and next
to go on and enroll Elis as an ally of Argos. This incident so<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[p. 18]</span> confirmed the Corinthians
in their previous scheme, that they speedily went to Argos, along
with the Chalkidians of Thrace, to join the new confederacy.</p>

<p>The conduct of Elis, like that of Mantineia, in thus revolting
from Sparta, had been dictated by private grounds of quarrel, arising
out of relations with their dependent ally Lepreum. The Lepreates
had become dependent on Elis some time before the beginning of the
Peloponnesian war, in consideration of aid lent by the Eleians to
extricate them from a dangerous war against some Arcadian enemies.
To purchase such aid, they had engaged to cede to the Eleians half
their territory; but had been left in residence and occupation of it,
under the stipulation of paying one talent yearly as tribute to the
Olympian Zeus; in other words, to the Eleians as his stewards. When
the Peloponnesian war began,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28"
class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and the Lacedæmonians began to call for
the unpaid service of the Peloponnesian cities generally, small as
well as great, against Athens, the Lepreates were, by the standing
agreement of the confederacy, exempted for the time from continuing
to pay their tribute to Elis. Such exemption ceased with the war; at
the close of which Elis became entitled, under the same agreement,
to resume the suspended tribute. She accordingly required that the
payment should then be recommenced: but the Lepreates refused, and
when she proceeded to apply force, threw themselves on the protection
of Sparta, by whose decision the Eleians themselves at first agreed
to abide, having the general agreement of the confederacy decidedly
in their favor. But it presently appeared that Sparta was more
disposed to carry out her general system of favoring the autonomy
of the lesser states, than to enforce the positive agreement of the
confederacy. Accordingly the Eleians, accusing her of unjust bias,
renounced her authority as arbitrator, and sent a military force
to occupy Lepreum. Nevertheless, the Spartans persisted in their
adjudication, pronounced Lepreum to be autonomous, and sent a body
of their own hoplites to defend it against<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_19">[p. 19]</span> the Eleians. The latter loudly protested
against this proceeding, and pronounced the Lacedæmonians as
having robbed them of one of their dependencies, contrary to that
agreement which had been adopted by the general confederacy when
the war began,—to the effect that each imperial city should receive
back at the end of the war all the dependencies which it possessed
at the beginning, on condition of waiving its title to tribute
and military service from them so long as the war lasted. After
fruitless remonstrances with Sparta, the Eleians eagerly embraced the
opportunity now offered of revolting from her, and of joining the new
league with Corinth and Argos.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29"
class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>That new league, including Argos, Corinth, Elis, and Mantineia,
had now acquired such strength and confidence, that the Argeians
and Corinthians proceeded on a joint embassy to Tegea to obtain the
junction of that city, seemingly the most<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_20">[p. 20]</span> powerful in Peloponnesus next to Sparta
and Argos. What grounds they had for expecting success we are
not told. The mere fact of Mantineia having joined Argos, seemed
likely to deter Tegea, as the rival Arcadian power, from doing
the same: and so it proved, for the Tegeans decidedly refused the
proposal, not without strenuous protestations that they would stand
by Sparta in everything. The Corinthians were greatly disheartened
by this repulse, which they had by no means expected, having been
so far misled by general expressions of discontent against Sparta
as to believe that they could transfer nearly the whole body of
confederates to Argos. But they now began to despair of all farther
extension of Argeian headship, and even to regard their own position
as insecure on the side of Athens; with whom they were not at peace,
while by joining Argos they had forfeited their claim upon Sparta
and all her confederacy, including Bœotia and Megara. In this
embarrassment they betook themselves to the Bœotians, whom they again
entreated to join them in the Argeian alliance: a request already
once refused, and not likely to be now granted, but intended to usher
in a different request preferred at the same time. The Bœotians were
entreated to accompany the Corinthians to Athens, and obtain for them
from the Athenians an armistice terminable at ten days’ notice, such
as that which they had contracted for themselves. In case of refusal,
they were farther entreated to throw up their own agreement, and to
conclude no other without the concurrence of the Corinthians. So
far the Bœotians complied, as to go to Athens with the Corinthians,
and back their application for an armistice, which the Athenians
declined to grant, saying that the Corinthians were already included
in the general peace, if they were allies of Sparta. On receiving
this answer the Corinthians entreated the Bœotians, putting it as
a matter of obligation, to renounce their own armistice, and make
common cause as to all future compact. But this request was steadily
refused. The Bœotians maintained their ten days’ armistice; and the
Corinthians were obliged to acquiesce in their existing condition of
peace <i>de facto</i>, though not guaranteed by any pledge of Athens.<a
id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[p. 21]</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile the Lacedæmonians were not unmindful of the affront
which they had sustained by the revolt of Mantineia and Elis. At the
request of a party among the Parrhasii, the Arcadian subjects of
Mantineia, they marched under king Pleistoanax into that territory,
and compelled the Mantineians to evacuate the fort which they had
erected within it; which the latter were unable to defend, though
they received a body of Argeian troops to guard their city, and
were thus enabled to march their whole force to the threatened
spot. Besides liberating the Arcadian subjects of Mantineia,
the Lacedæmonians also planted an additional body of Helots and
Neodamodes at <span id="See_1">Lepreum</span>, as a defence and means of observation on
the frontiers of Elis.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31"
class="fnanchor">[31]</a> These were the Brasidean soldiers, whom
Klearidas had now brought back from Thrace. The Helots among them had
been manumitted as a reward, and allowed to reside where they chose.
But as they had imbibed lessons of bravery under their distinguished
commander, their presence would undoubtedly be dangerous among the
serfs of Laconia: hence the disposition of the Lacedæmonians to
plant them out. We may recollect that not very long before, they
had caused two thousand of the most soldierly Helots to be secretly
assassinated, without any ground of suspicion against these victims
personally, but simply from fear of the whole body and of course
greater fear of the bravest.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32"
class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[p. 22]</span></p>

<p>It was not only against danger from the returning Brasidean Helots
that the Lacedæmonians had to guard, but also against danger—real
or supposed—from their own Spartan captives, liberated by Athens
at the conclusion of the recent alliance. Though the surrender of
Sphakteria had been untarnished by any dishonor, nevertheless these
men could hardly fail to be looked upon as degraded, in the eyes
of Spartan pride; or at least they might fancy that they were so
looked upon, and thus become discontented. Some of them were already
in the exercise of various functions, when the ephors contracted
suspicions of their designs, and condemned them all to temporary
disqualification for any official post, placing the whole of their
property under trust-management, and interdicting them, like minors,
from every act either of purchase or sale.<a id="FNanchor_33"
href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> This species of
disfranchisement lasted for a considerable time; but the sufferers
were at length relieved from it, the danger being supposed to be
over. The nature of the interdict confirms, what we know directly
from Thucydidês, that many of these captives were among the first and
wealthiest families in the state, and the ephors may have apprehended
that they would employ their wealth in acquiring partisans and
organizing revolt among the Helots. We have no facts to enable
us to appreciate the situation; but the ungenerous spirit of the
regulation, as applied to brave warriors recently come home from a
long imprisonment—justly pointed out by modern historians—would not
weigh much with the ephors under any symptoms of public danger.</p>

<p>Of the proceedings of the Athenians during this summer we hear
nothing, except that the town of Skiônê at length surrendered to
them after a long-continued blockade, and that they put to death the
male population of military age, selling the women and children into
slavery. The odium of having proposed this cruel resolution two years
and a half before, belongs to Kleon; that of executing it, nearly a
year after his death, to the leaders who succeeded him, and to his
countrymen generally. The reader will, however, now be sufficiently
accustomed to the Greek laws of war not to be surprised at such
treatment against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[p. 23]</span>
subjects revolted and reconquered. Skiônê and its territory was made
over to the Platæan refugees. The native population of Delos, also,
who had been removed from that sacred spot during the preceding year,
under the impression that they were too impure for the discharge of
the sacerdotal functions, were now restored to their island. The
subsequent defeat of Amphipolis had created a belief at Athens that
this removal had offended the gods; under which impression, confirmed
by the Delphian oracle, the Athenians now showed their repentance by
restoring the Delian exiles.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34"
class="fnanchor">[34]</a> They farther lost the towns of Thyssus on
the peninsula of Athos, and Mekyberna on the Sithonian gulf, which
were captured by the Chalkidians of Thrace.<a id="FNanchor_35"
href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the political relations throughout the powerful Grecian
states remained all provisional and undetermined. The alliance still
subsisted between Sparta and Athens, yet with continual complaints on
the part of the latter that the prior treaty remained unfulfilled.
The members of the Spartan confederacy were discontented; some had
seceded, and others seemed likely to do the same; while Argos,
ambitious to supplant Sparta, was trying to put herself at the head
of a new confederacy, though as yet with very partial success.
Hitherto, however, the authorities of Sparta—king Pleistoanax as well
as the ephors of the year—had been sincerely desirous to maintain
the Athenian alliance, so far as it could be done without sacrifice,
and without the real employment of force against recusants, of which
they had merely talked in order to amuse the Athenians. Moreover,
the prodigious advantage which they had gained by recovering the
prisoners, doubtless making them very popular at home, would attach
them the more firmly to their own measure. But at the close of the
summer—seemingly about the end of September or beginning of October,
<small>B.C.</small> 421—the year of these ephors expired,
and new ephors were nominated for the ensuing year. Under the
existing state of things this was an important revolution: for out of
the five new ephors, two—Kleobûlus and Xenarês—were decidedly hostile
to peace with Athens, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[p.
24]</span> the remaining three apparently indifferent.<a
id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> And
we may here remark, that this fluctuation and instability of public
policy, which is often denounced as if it were the peculiar attribute
of a democracy, occurs quite as much under the constitutional
monarchy of Sparta, the least popular government in Greece, both in
principle and detail.</p>

<p>The new ephors convened a special congress at Sparta for the
settlement of the pending differences, at which among the rest
Athenian, Bœotian, and Corinthian envoys were all present. But,
after prolonged debates, no approach was made to agreement; so that
the congress was on the point of breaking up, when Kleobûlus and
Xenarês, together with many of their partisans,<a id="FNanchor_37"
href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> originated, in concert
with the Bœotian and Corinthian deputies, a series of private
underhand manœuvres for the dissolution of the Athenian alliance.
This was to be effected by bringing about a separate alliance between
Argos and Sparta, which the Spartans sincerely desired, and would
grasp at in preference, so these ephors affirmed, even if it cost
them the breach of their new tie with Athens. The Bœotians were
urged, first to become allies of Argos themselves, and then to bring
Argos into alliance with Sparta. But it was farther essential that
they should give up Panaktum to Sparta, so that it might be tendered
to the Athenians in exchange for Pylos; for Sparta could not easily
go to war with them while they remained masters of the latter.<a
id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Such were the plans which Kleobûlus and Xenarês laid with the
Corinthian and Bœotian deputies, and which the latter went home
prepared to execute. Chance seemed to favor the purpose at once: for
on their road home, they were accosted by two Argeians, senators
in their own city, who expressed an earnest anxiety to bring about
alliance between the Bœotians and Argos. The Bœotian deputies, warmly
encouraging this idea, urged the Argeians to send envoys to Thebes
as solicitors of the alliance; and communicated to the bœotarchs, on
their arrival at home, both the plans laid by the Spartan ephors and
the wishes of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[p. 25]</span>
Argeians. The bœotarchs also entered heartily into the entire scheme;
receiving the Argeian envoys with marked favor, and promising, as
soon as they should have obtained the requisite sanction, to send
envoys of their own and ask for alliance with Argos.</p>

<p>That sanction was to be obtained from “the Four Senates of
the Bœotians;” bodies, of the constitution of which nothing is
known. But they were usually found so passive and acquiescent
that the bœotarchs, reckoning upon their assent as a matter of
course, even without any full exposition of reasons, laid all
their plans accordingly.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39"
class="fnanchor">[39]</a> They proposed to these four Senates a
resolution in general terms, empowering themselves in the name
of the Bœotian federation to exchange oaths of alliance with any
Grecian city which might be willing to contract on terms mutually
beneficial: their particular object being, as they stated, to form
alliance with the Corinthians, Megarians, and Chalkidians of Thrace,
for mutual defence, and for war as well as peace with others only
by common consent. To this specific object they anticipated no
resistance on the part of the Senates, inasmuch as their connection
with Corinth had always been intimate, while the position of
the four parties named was the same, all being recusants of the
recent peace. But the resolution was advisedly couched in the most
comprehensive terms, in order that it might authorize them to
proceed farther afterwards, and conclude alliance on the part of
the Bœotians and Megarians with Argos; that ulterior purpose being
however for the present kept back, because alliance with Argos was
a novelty which might surprise and alarm the Senates. The manœuvre,
skilfully contrived for entrapping these bodies into an approval of
measures which they never contemplated, illustrates the manner in
which an oligarchical executive could elude the checks devised to
control its proceedings. But the bœotarchs, to their astonishment,
found themselves defeated at the outset: for the Senates would
not even hear of alliance with Corinth, so much did they fear to
offend Sparta by any special connection with a city which had<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[p. 26]</span> revolted from her. Nor
did the bœotarchs think it safe to divulge their communications
with Kleobûlus and Xenarês, or to acquaint the Senates that the
whole plan originated with a powerful party in Sparta herself.
Accordingly, under this formal refusal on the part of the Senates,
no farther proceedings could be taken. The Corinthian and Chalkidian
envoys left Thebes, while the promise of sending Bœotian envoys to
Argos remained unexecuted.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40"
class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>But the anti-Athenian ephors at Sparta, though baffled in their
schemes for arriving at the Argeian alliance through the agency of
the Bœotians, did not the less persist in their views upon Panaktum.
That place—a frontier fortress in the mountainous range between
Attica and Bœotia, apparently on the Bœotian side of Phylê, and on or
near the direct road from Athens to Thebes which led through Phylê<a
id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>—had
been an Athenian possession, until six months before the peace,
when it had been treacherously betrayed to the Bœotians.<a
id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> A
special provision of the treaty between Athens and Sparta, prescribed
that it should be restored to Athens; and Lacedæmonian envoys were
now sent on an express mission to Bœotia, to request from the
Bœotians the delivery of Panaktum as well as of their Athenian
captives, in order that by tendering these to Athens she might be
induced to surrender Pylos. The Bœotians refused compliance with
this request, except on condition that Sparta should enter into
special alliance with them as she had done with the Athenians.
Now the Spartans stood pledged by their covenant with the latter,
either by its terms or by its recognized import, not to enter into
any new alliance without their consent. But they were eagerly bent
upon getting possession of Panaktum; while the prospect of breach
with Athens, far from being a deterring motive, was exactly that
which Kleobûlus and Xenarês desired. Under these feelings, the
Lacedæmonians consented to and swore the special alliance with
Bœotia. But the Bœotians, instead of handing over Panaktum for
surrender, as they had promised, immediately razed the fortress to
the ground; under pretence of some ancient<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_27">[p. 27]</span> oaths which had been exchanged between
their ancestors and the Athenians, to the effect that the district
round it should always remain without resident inhabitants, as a
neutral strip of borderland, and under common pasture.</p>

<p>These negotiations, after having been in progress throughout
the winter, ended in the accomplishment of the alliance and the
destruction of Panaktum at the beginning of spring or about the
middle of March. And while the Lacedæmonian ephors thus seemed to
be carrying their point on the side of Bœotia, they were agreeably
surprised by an unexpected encouragement to their views from another
quarter. An embassy arrived at Sparta from Argos, to solicit renewal
of the peace just expiring. The Argeians found that they made no
progress in the enlargement of their newly-formed confederacy, while
their recent disappointment with the Bœotians made them despair of
realizing their ambitious projects of Peloponnesian headship. But
when they learned that the Lacedæmonians had concluded a separate
alliance with the Bœotians, and that Panaktum had been razed, their
disappointment was converted into positive alarm for the future.
Naturally inferring that this new alliance would not have been
concluded except in concert with Athens, they interpreted the whole
proceeding as indicating that Sparta had prevailed upon the Bœotians
to accept the peace with Athens, the destruction of Panaktum being
conceived as a compromise to obviate disputes respecting possession.
Under such a persuasion,—noway unreasonable in itself, when the two
contracting governments, both oligarchical and both secret, furnished
no collateral evidence to explain their real intent,—the Argeians saw
themselves excluded from alliance not merely with Bœotia, Sparta,
and Tegea, but also with Athens; which latter city they had hitherto
regarded as a sure resort in case of hostility with Sparta. Without
a moment’s delay, they despatched Eustrophus and Æson, two Argeians
much esteemed at Sparta, and perhaps proxeni of that city, to press
for a renewal of their expiring truce with the Spartans, and to
obtain the best terms they could.</p>

<p>To the Lacedæmonian ephors this application was eminently
acceptable, the very event which they had been manœuvring underhand
to bring about: and negotiations were opened, in which the Argeian
envoys at first proposed that the disputed<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_28">[p. 28]</span> possession of Thyrea should be referred
to arbitration. But they found their demand met by a peremptory
negative, the Lacedæmonians refusing to enter upon such a discussion,
and insisting upon simple renewal of the peace now at an end. At
last the Argeian envoys, eagerly bent upon keeping the question
respecting Thyrea open, in some way or other, prevailed upon the
Lacedæmonians to assent to the following singular agreement. Peace
was concluded between Athens and Sparta for fifty years; but if
at any moment within that interval, excluding either periods of
epidemic or periods of war, it should suit the views of either party
to provoke a combat by chosen champions of equal number for the
purpose of determining the right to Thyrea, there was to be full
liberty of doing so; the combat to take place within the territory of
Thyrea itself, and the victors to be interdicted from pursuing the
vanquished beyond the undisputed border of either territory. It will
be recollected, that about one hundred and twenty years before this
date, there had been a combat of this sort by three hundred champions
on each side, in which, after desperate valor on both sides, the
victory as well as the disputed right still remained undetermined.
The proposition made by the Argeians was a revival of this old
practice of judicial combat: nevertheless, such was the alteration
which the Greek mind had undergone during the interval, that it now
appeared a perfect absurdity, even in the eyes of the Lacedæmonians,
the most old-fashioned people in Greece.<a id="FNanchor_43"
href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Yet since they hazarded
nothing, practically, by so vague a concession, and were supremely
anxious to make their relations smooth with Argos, in contemplation
of a breach with Athens, they at last agreed to the condition, drew
up the treaty, and placed it in the hands of the envoys to carry back
to Argos. Formal acceptance and ratification, by the Argeian public
assembly, was necessary to give it validity: should this be granted,
the envoys were invited to return to Sparta at<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_29">[p. 29]</span> the festival of the Hyakinthia, and there
go through the solemnity of the oaths.</p>

<p>Amidst such strange crossing of purposes and interests, the
Spartan ephors seemed now to have carried all their points;
friendship with Argos, breach with Athens, and yet the means—through
the possession of Panaktum—of procuring from Athens the cession of
Pylos. But they were not yet on firm ground. For when their deputies,
Andromedês and two colleagues, arrived in Bœotia for the purpose of
going on to Athens and prosecuting the negotiation about Panaktum, at
the time when Eustrophus and Æson were carrying on their negotiation
at Sparta, they discovered for the first time that the Bœotians,
instead of performing their promise to hand over Panaktum, had razed
it to the ground. This was a serious blow to their chance of success
at Athens: nevertheless, Andromedês proceeded thither, taking with
him all the Athenian captives in Bœotia. These he restored at Athens,
at the same time announcing the demolition of Panaktum as a fact:
Panaktum as well as the prisoners was thus <i>restored</i>, he pretended;
for the Athenians would not now find a single enemy in the place:
and he claimed the cession of Pylos in exchange.<a id="FNanchor_44"
href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>But he soon found that the final term of Athenian compliance had
been reached. It was probably on this occasion that the separate
alliance concluded between Sparta and the Bœotians first became
discovered at Athens; since not only were the proceedings of these
oligarchical governments habitually secret, but there was a peculiar
motive for keeping this alliance concealed until the discussion about
Panaktum and Pylos had been brought to a close. Both this alliance,
and the demolition of Panaktum, excited among the Athenians the
strongest marks of disgust and anger; aggravated probably rather
than softened by the quibble of Andromedês, that demolition of the
fort, being tantamount to restitution, and precluding any farther
tenancy by the enemy, was a substantial satisfaction of the treaty;
and aggravated still farther by the recollection of all the other
unperformed items in the treaty. A whole year had now elapsed, amidst
frequent notes and protocols, to employ a modern phrase; yet not one
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[p. 30]</span> the conditions
favorable to Athens had yet been executed, except the restitution of
her captives, seemingly not many in number; while she on her side had
made to Sparta the capital cession on which almost everything hinged.
A long train of accumulated indignation, brought to a head by this
mission of Andromedês, discharged itself in the harshest dismissal
and rebuke of himself and his colleagues.<a id="FNanchor_45"
href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Even Nikias, Lachês, and the other leading men, to whose improvident
facility and misjudgment the embarrassment of the moment was owing,
were probably not much behind the general public in exclamation
against Spartan perfidy, if it were only to divert attention from
their own mistake. But there was one of them—Alkibiadês son of
Kleinias—who took this opportunity of putting himself at the head of
the vehement anti-Laconian sentiment which now agitated the ekklesia,
and giving to it a substantive aim.</p>

<p>The present is the first occasion on which we hear of this
remarkable man as taking a prominent part in public life. He was
now about thirty-one or thirty-two years old, which in Greece was
considered an early age for a man to exercise important command.
But such was the splendor, wealth, and antiquity of his family, of
Æakid lineage through the heroes Eurysakês and Ajax, and such the
effect of that lineage upon the democratical public of Athens,<a
id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> that
he stepped speedily and easily into a conspicuous station. Belonging
also through his mother Deinomachê to the gens of the Alkmæonidæ, he
was related to Periklês, who became his guardian when he was left
an orphan at about five years old, along with his younger brother
Kleinias. It was at that time that their father Kleinias was slain
at the battle of Koroneia, having already served with honor in a
trireme of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[p. 31]</span>
own at the sea-fight of Artemisium against the Persians. A Spartan
nurse named Amykla was provided for the young Alkibiadês, and a slave
named Zopyrus chosen by his distinguished guardian to watch over him;
but even his boyhood was utterly ungovernable, and Athens was full
of his freaks and enormities, to the unavailing regret of Periklês
and his brother Ariphron.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47"
class="fnanchor">[47]</a> His violent passions, love of enjoyment,
ambition of preëminence, and insolence towards others,<a
id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> were
manifested at an early age, and never deserted him throughout his
life. His finished beauty of person both as boy, youth, and mature
man, caused him to be much run after by women,<a id="FNanchor_49"
href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and even by women of
generally reserved habits. Moreover, even before the age when such
temptations were usually presented, the beauty of his earlier youth,
while going through the ordinary gymnastic training, procured for him
assiduous caresses, compliments, and solicitations of every sort,
from the leading Athenians who frequented the public palæstræ. These
men not only endured his petulance, but were even flattered when
he would condescend to bestow it upon them. Amidst such universal
admiration and indulgence, amidst corrupting influences exercised
from so many quarters and from so early an age, combined with great
wealth and the highest position, it was not likely that either
self-restraint or regard for the welfare of others would ever acquire
development in the mind of Alkibiadês. The anecdotes which fill his
biography reveal the utter absence of both these constituent elements
of morality; and though, in regard to the particular stories,
allowance must doubtless be made for scandal and exaggeration, yet
the general type<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[p. 32]</span>
of character stands plainly marked and sufficiently established in
all.</p>

<p>A dissolute life, and an immoderate love of pleasure in all
its forms, is what we might naturally expect from a young man so
circumstanced; and it appears that with him these tastes were
indulged with an offensive publicity which destroyed the comfort
of his wife Hipparetê, daughter of Hipponikus who was slain at
the battle of Delium. She had brought him a large dowry of ten
talents: when she sought a divorce, as the law of Athens permitted,
Alkibiadês violently interposed to prevent her from obtaining the
benefit of the law, and brought her back by force to his house even
from the presence of the magistrate. It is this violence of selfish
passion, and reckless disregard of social obligation towards every
one, which forms the peculiar characteristic of Alkibiadês. He
strikes the schoolmaster whose house he happens to find unprovided
with a copy of Homer; he strikes Taureas,<a id="FNanchor_50"
href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> a rival chorêgus,
in the public theatre, while the representation is going on; he
strikes Hipponikus, who afterwards became his father-in-law, out of
a wager of mere wantonness, afterwards appeasing him by an ample
apology; he protects the Thasian poet Hêgêmon, against whom an
indictment had been formally lodged before the archon, by effacing
it with his own hand from the published list in the public edifice,
called Metrôon; defying both magistrate and accuser to press
the cause on for trial.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51"
class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Nor does it appear that any injured person
ever dared to bring Alkibiadês to trial before the dikastery, though
we read with amazement the tissue of lawlessness<a id="FNanchor_52"
href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> which marked his
private life;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[p. 33]</span>
a combination of insolence and ostentation with occasional mean
deceit when it suited his purpose. But amidst the perfect legal,
judicial, and constitutional equality, which reigned among the
citizens of Athens, there still remained great social inequalities
between one man and another, handed down from the times preceding
the democracy: inequalities which the democratical institutions
limited in their practical mischiefs, but never either effaced or
discredited, and which were recognized as modifying elements in
the current, unconscious vein of sentiment and criticism, by those
whom they injured as well as by those whom they favored. In the
speech which Thucydidês<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53"
class="fnanchor">[53]</a> ascribes to Alkibiadês before the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[p. 34]</span> Athenian public assembly,
we find the insolence of wealth and high social position not only
admitted as a fact, but vindicated as a just morality; and the
history of his life, as well as many other facts in Athenian society,
show that if not approved, it was at least tolerated in practice to a
serious extent, in spite of the restraints of the democracy.</p>

<p>Amidst such unprincipled exorbitances of behavior, Alkibiadês
stood distinguished for personal bravery. He served as a hoplite
in the army under Phormion at the siege of Potidæa in 432
<small>B.C.</small> Though then hardly twenty years of age, he was
among the most forward soldiers in the battle, received a severe
wound, and was in great danger; owing his life only to the exertions
of Sokratês, who served in the ranks along with him. Eight years
afterwards, Alkibiadês also served with credit in the cavalry at
the battle of Delium, and had the opportunity of requiting his
obligation to Sokratês, by protecting him against the Bœotian
pursuers. As a rich young man, also, choregy and trierarchy became
incumbent upon him; expensive duties, which, as we might expect, he
discharged not merely with sufficiency, but with ostentation. In
fact, expenditure of this sort, though compulsory up to a certain
point upon all rich men, was so fully repaid, to all those who had
the least ambition, in the shape of popularity and influence, that
most of them spontaneously went beyond the requisite minimum for the
purpose of showing themselves off. The first appearance of Alkibiadês
in public life is said to have been as a donor, for some special
purpose, in the ekklesia, when various citizens were handing in
their contributions: and the loud applause which his subscription
provoked was at that time so novel and exciting to him, that he
suffered a tame quail which he carried in his bosom to escape. This
incident excited mirth and sympathy among the citizens present: the
bird was caught and restored to him by Antiochus, who from that
time forward acquired his favor, and in after days became his pilot
and confidential lieutenant.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54"
class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>To a young man like Alkibiadês, thirsting for power and
pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[p. 35]</span>ëminence, a
certain measure of rhetorical facility and persuasive power was
indispensable. With a view to this acquisition, he frequented
the society of various sophistical and rhetorical teachers,<a
id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
Prodikus, Protagoras, and others; but most of all that of Sokratês.
His intimacy with Sokratês has become celebrated on many grounds,
and is commemorated both by Plato and Xenophon, though unfortunately
with less instruction than we could desire. We may readily believe
Xenophon, when he tells us that Alkibiadês—like the oligarchical
Kritias, of whom we shall have much to say hereafter—was attracted
to Sokratês by his unrivalled skill of dialectical conversation, his
suggestive influence over the minds of his hearers, in eliciting
new thoughts and combinations, his mastery of apposite and homely
illustrations, his power of seeing far beforehand the end of a long
cross-examination, his ironical affectation of ignorance, whereby
the humiliation of opponents was rendered only the more complete,
when they were convicted of inconsistency and contradiction out
of their own answers. The exhibitions of such ingenuity were in
themselves highly interesting, and stimulating to the mental
activity of listeners, while the faculty itself was one of peculiar
value to those who proposed to take the lead in public debate;
with which view both these ambitious young men tried to catch
the knack from Sokratês,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56"
class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and to copy his formidable string of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[p. 36]</span> interrogations. Both of
them doubtless involuntarily respected the poor, self-sufficing,
honest, temperate, and brave citizen, in whom this eminent talent
resided; especially Alkibiadês, who not only owed his life to the
generous valor of Sokratês at Potidæa, but had also learned in that
service to admire the iron physical frame of the philosopher in
his armor, enduring hunger, cold, and hardship.<a id="FNanchor_57"
href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> But we are not to
suppose that either of them came to Sokratês with the purpose of
hearing and obeying his precepts on matters of duty, or receiving
from him a new plan of life. They came partly to gratify an
intellectual appetite, partly to acquire a stock of words and
ideas, with facility of argumentative handling, suitable for their
after-purpose as public speakers. Subjects moral, political, and
intellectual, served as the theme sometimes of discourse, sometimes
of discussion, in the society of all these sophists, Prodikus
and Protagoras not less than Sokratês; for in the Athenian sense
of the word, Sokratês was a sophist as well as the others: and
to the rich youths of Athens, like Alkibiadês and Kritias, such
society was highly useful.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58"
class="fnanchor">[58]</a> It imparted a nobler aim to their ambition,
including<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[p. 37]</span> mental
accomplishments as well as political success: it enlarged the
range of their understandings, and opened to them as ample a vein
of literature and criticism as the age afforded: it accustomed
them to canvass human conduct, with the causes and obstructions
of human well-being, both public and private: it even suggested
to them indirectly lessons of duty and prudence, from which their
social position tended to estrange them, and which they would
hardly have submitted to hear except from the lips of one whom they
intellectually admired. In learning to talk, they were forced to
learn more or less to think, and familiarized with the difference
between truth and error: nor would an eloquent lecturer fail to
enlist their feelings in the great topics of morals and politics.
Their thirst for mental stimulus and rhetorical accomplishments had
thus, as far as it went, a moralizing effect, though this was rarely
their purpose in the pursuit.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59"
class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[p. 38]</span></p>

<p>Alkibiadês, full of impulse and ambition of every kind, enjoyed
the conversation of all the eminent talkers and lecturers to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[p. 39]</span> be found in Athens,
that of Sokratês most of all and most frequently. The philosopher
became greatly attached to him, and doubtless lost no opportunity
of inculcating on him salutary lessons, as far as could be done,
without disgusting the pride of a haughty and spoiled youth who was
looking forward to the celebrity of public life. But unhappily his
lessons never produced any serious effect, and ultimately became
even distasteful to the pupil. The whole life of Alkibiadês attests
how faintly the sentiment of obligation, public or private, ever got
footing in his mind; how much the ends which he pursued were dictated
by overbearing vanity and love of aggrandizement. In the later part
of life, Sokratês was marked out to public hatred by his enemies, as
having been the teacher of Alkibiadês and Kritias. And if we could
be so unjust as to judge of the morality of the teacher by that of
these two pupils, we should certainly rank him among the worst of the
Athenian sophists.</p>

<p>At the age of thirty-one or thirty-two, the earliest at which
it was permitted to look forward to an ascendent position in
public life, Alkibiadês came forward with a reputation stained by
private enormities, and with a number of enemies created by his
insolent demeanor. But this did not hinder him from stepping into
that position to which his rank, connections, and club-partisans,
afforded him introduction; nor was he slow in displaying his
extraordinary energy, decision, and capacity of command. From the
beginning to the end of his eventful political life, he showed a
combination of boldness in design, resource in contrivance, and
vigor in execution, not surpassed by any one of his contemporary
Greeks: and what distinguished him from all was his extraordinary
flexibility of character<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60"
class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and consummate<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_40">[p. 40]</span> power of adapting himself to new habits,
new necessities, and new persons, whenever circumstances required.
Like Themistoklês, whom he resembled as well in ability and vigor
as in want of public principle and in recklessness about means,
Alkibiadês was essentially a man of action. Eloquence was in him a
secondary quality, subordinate to action; and though he possessed
enough of it for his purposes, his speeches were distinguished
only for pertinence of matter, often imperfectly expressed, at
least according to the high standard of Athens.<a id="FNanchor_61"
href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> But his career affords
a memorable example of splendid qualities, both for action and
command, ruined and turned into instruments of mischief by the utter
want of morality, public and private. A strong tide of individual
hatred was thus roused against him, as well from middling citizens
whom he had insulted, as from rich men whom his ruinous ostentation
outshone. For his exorbitant voluntary expenditure in the public
festivals, transcending the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[p.
41]</span> largest measure of private fortune, satisfied discerning
men that he would reimburse himself by plundering the public, and
even, if opportunity offered, by overthrowing<a id="FNanchor_62"
href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> the constitution
to make himself master of the persons and properties of his
fellow-citizens. He never inspired confidence or esteem in any one;
and sooner or later, among a public like that of Athens, so much
accumulated odium and suspicion was sure to bring a public man to
ruin, in spite of the strongest admiration for his capacity. He was
always the object of very conflicting sentiments: “The Athenians
desired him, hated him, but still wished to have him,” was said
in the latter years of his life by a contemporary poet; while we
find also another pithy precept delivered in regard to him: “You
ought not to keep a lion’s whelp in your city at all; but, if you
choose to keep him, you must submit yourself to his behavior.”<a
id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Athens
had to feel the force of his energy, as an exile and enemy, but
the great harm which he did to her was in his capacity of adviser;
awakening in his countrymen the same thirst for showy, rapacious,
uncertain, perilous aggrandizement which dictated his own personal
actions.</p>

<p>Mentioning Alkibiadês now for the first time, I have somewhat
anticipated on future chapters, in order to present a general idea of
his character, hereafter to be illustrated. But at the moment which
we have now reached (March, 420 <small>B.C.</small>)
the lion’s whelp was yet young, and had neither acquired his entire
strength nor disclosed his full-grown claws.</p>

<p>He began to put himself forward as a party leader, seemingly
not long before the Peace of Nikias. The political traditions
hereditary in his family, as in that of his relation Periklês, were
democratical: his grandfather Alkibiadês had been vehement in his
opposition to the Peisistratids, and had even afterwards publicly
renounced an established connection of hospitality with the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[p. 42]</span> Lacedæmonian government,
from strong antipathy to them on political grounds. But Alkibiadês
himself, in commencing political life, departed from this family
tradition, and presented himself as a partisan of oligarchical and
philo-Laconian sentiment, doubtless far more consonant to his natural
temper than the democratical. He thus started in the same general
party with Nikias and Thessalus son of Kimôn, who afterwards became
his bitter opponents; and it was in part probably to put himself
on a par with them, that he took the marked step of trying to
revive the ancient family tie of hospitality with Sparta, which his
grandfather had broken off.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64"
class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>To promote this object, he displayed peculiar solicitude for the
good treatment of the Spartan captives, during their detention at
Athens. Many of them being of high family at Sparta, he naturally
calculated upon their gratitude, as well as upon the favorable
sympathies of their countrymen, whenever they should be restored.
He advocated both the peace and the alliance with Sparta, and the
restoration of her captives; and indeed not only advocated these
measures, but tendered his services, and was eager to be employed,
as the agent of Sparta for carrying them through at Athens. From
these selfish hopes in regard to Sparta, and especially from the
expectation of acquiring, through the agency of the restored
captives, the title of Proxenus of Sparta, Alkibiadês thus became
a partisan of the blind and gratuitous philo-Laconian concessions
of Nikias. But the captives on their return were either unable, or
unwilling, to carry the point which he wished; while the authorities
at Sparta rejected all his advances, not without a contemptuous
sneer at the idea of confiding important political interests to
the care of a youth chiefly known for ostentation, profligacy, and
insolence. That the Spartans should thus judge, is noway astonishing,
considering their extreme reverence both for old age and for strict
discipline. They naturally preferred Nikias and Lachês, whose
prudence would commend, if it did not originally suggest, their
mistrust of the new claimant. Nor had Alkibiadês yet shown the
mighty move<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[p. 43]</span>ment
of which he was capable. But this contemptuous refusal of the
Spartans stung him so to the quick, that, making an entire revolution
in his political course,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65"
class="fnanchor">[65]</a> he immediately threw himself into
anti-Laconian politics with an energy and ability which he was not
before known to possess.</p>

<p>The moment was favorable, since the recent death of Kleon, for a
new political leader to espouse this side; and was rendered still
more favorable by the conduct of the Lacedæmonians. Month after month
passed, remonstrance after remonstrance was addressed, yet not one
of the restitutions prescribed by the treaty in favor of Athens had
yet been accomplished. Alkibiadês had therefore ample pretext for
altering his tone respecting the Spartans, and for denouncing them
as deceivers who had broken their solemn oaths, abusing the generous
confidence of Athens. Under his present antipathies, his attention
naturally turned to Argos, in which city he possessed some powerful
friends and family guests. The condition of that city, now free by
the expiration of the peace with Sparta, opened a possibility of
connection with Athens, and this policy was strongly recommended
by Alkibiadês, who insisted that Sparta was playing false with the
Athenians, merely in order to keep their hands tied until she had
attacked and put down Argos separately. This particular argument had
less force when it was seen that Argos acquired new and powerful
allies, Mantineia, Elis, and Corinth; but on the other hand, such
acquisitions rendered Argos positively more valuable as an ally to
the Athenians.</p>

<p>It was not so much, however, the inclination towards Argos, but
the growing wrath against Sparta, which furthered the philo-Argeian
plans of Alkibiadês; and when the Lacedæmonian envoy Andromedês
arrived at Athens from Bœotia, tendering to the Athenians the mere
ruins of Panaktum in exchange for Pylos; when it farther became
known that the Spartans had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[p.
44]</span> already concluded a special alliance with the Bœotians
without consulting Athens, the unmeasured expression of displeasure
in the Athenian ekklesia showed Alkibiadês that the time was now
come for bringing on a substantive decision. While he lent his
own voice to strengthen this discontent against Sparta, he at the
same time despatched a private intimation to his correspondents at
Argos, exhorting them, under assurances of success and promise of
his own strenuous aid, to send without delay an embassy to Athens
in conjunction with the Mantineians and Eleians, requesting to be
admitted as Athenian allies. The Argeians received this intimation
at the very moment when their citizens Eustrophus and Æson were
negotiating at Sparta for the renewal of the peace, having been sent
thither under great uneasiness lest Argos should be left without
allies to contend single-handed against the Lacedæmonians. But
no sooner was the unexpected chance held out to them of alliance
with Athens, a former friend, a democracy like their own, an
imperial state at sea, but not interfering with their own primacy
in Peloponnesus,—than they became careless of Eustrophus and Æson,
and despatched forthwith to Athens the embassy advised. It was a
joint embassy, Argeian, Eleian, and Mantineian:<a id="FNanchor_66"
href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> the alliance between
these three cities had already been rendered more intimate by a
second treaty concluded since that treaty to which Corinth was
a party; but Corinth had refused all concern in the second.<a
id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>But the Spartans had been already alarmed by the harsh repulse of
their envoy Andromedês, and probably warned by reports from Nikias
and their other Athenian friends of the crisis impending respecting
alliance between Athens and Argos. Accordingly they sent off without
a moment’s delay three citizens extremely popular at Athens,<a
id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
Philocharidas, Leon, and Endius; with full powers to settle all
matters of difference. The envoys were instructed to deprecate all
alliance of Athens with Argos, to explain that the alliance of Sparta
with Bœotia had been concluded without any purpose or possibility of
evil to Athens, and at the same time to renew the demand that Pylos
should be re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[p. 45]</span>stored
to them in exchange for the demolished Panaktum. Such was still the
confidence of the Lacedæmonians in the strength of assent at Athens,
that they did not yet despair of obtaining an affirmative, even to
this very unequal proposition: and when the three envoys, under the
introduction and advice of Nikias, had their first interview with
the Athenian senate, preparatory to an audience before the public
assembly, the impression which they made, on stating that they came
with full powers of settlement, was highly favorable. It was indeed
so favorable, that Alkibiadês became alarmed lest, if they made the
same statement in the public assembly, holding out the prospect of
some trifling concessions, the philo-Laconian party might determine
public feeling to accept a compromise, and thus preclude all idea of
alliance with Argos.</p>

<p>To obviate such a defeat of his plans, he resorted to a
singular manœuvre. One of the Lacedæmonian envoys, Endius, was his
private guest, by an ancient and particular intimacy subsisting
between their two families.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69"
class="fnanchor">[69]</a> This probably assisted in procuring<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[p. 46]</span> for him a secret
interview with the envoys, and enabled him to address them with
greater effect, on the day before the meeting of the public assembly,
and without the knowledge of Nikias. He accosted them in the tone of
a friend of Sparta, anxious that their proposition should succeed;
but he intimated that they would find the public assembly turbulent
and angry, very different from the tranquil demeanor of the senate:
so that if they proclaimed themselves to have come with full powers
of settlement, the people would burst out with fury, to act upon
their fears and bully them into extravagant concessions. He therefore
strongly urged them to declare that they had come, not with any
full powers of settlement, but merely to explain, discuss, and
report: the people would then find that they could gain nothing by
intimidation, explanations would be heard, and disputed points be
discussed with temper, and he (Alkibiadês) would speak emphatically
in their favor. He would advise, and felt confident that he could
persuade, the Athenians to restore Pylos, a step which his opposition
had hitherto been the chief means of preventing. He gave them his
solemn pledge—confirmed by an oath, according to Plutarch—that he
would adopt this conduct, if they would act upon his counsel.<a
id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
The envoys were much struck with the apparent sagacity of
these suggestions,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71"
class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and still more delighted to find that
the man from whom they anticipated the most formidable opposition
was prepared to speak in their favor. His language obtained with
them, probably, the more ready admission and confidence, inasmuch
as he had volunteered his services to become the political agent
of Sparta only a few months before; and he appeared now to be
simply resuming that policy. They were sure of the support of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[p. 47]</span> Nikias and his party,
under all circumstances; if, by complying with the recommendation of
Alkibiadês, they could gain <i>his</i> strenuous advocacy and influence
also, they fancied that their cause was sure of success. Accordingly,
they agreed to act upon his suggestion, not only without consulting
but without even warning Nikias, which was exactly what Alkibiadês
desired, and had probably required them to promise.</p>

<p>Next day, the public assembly met, and the envoys were introduced;
upon which Alkibiadês himself, in a tone of peculiar mildness, put
the question to them, upon what footing they came?<a id="FNanchor_72"
href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> what powers they
brought with them? They immediately declared that they had brought
no full powers for treating and settlement, but only came to
explain and discuss. Nothing could exceed the astonishment with
which this declaration was heard. The senators present, to whom
these envoys a day or two before had publicly declared the distinct
contrary,—the assembled people, who, made aware of this previous
affirmation, had come prepared to hear the ultimatum of Sparta from
their lips,—lastly, most of all, Nikias himself,—their confidential
agent and probably their host at Athens,—who had doubtless announced
them as plenipotentiaries, and concerted with them the management
of their cases before the assembly,—all were alike astounded, and
none knew what to make of the words just heard. But the indignation
of the people equalled their astonishment: there was a unanimous
burst of wrath against the standing faithlessness and duplicity
of Lacedæmonians; never saying the same thing two days together.
To crown the whole, Alkibiadês himself affected to share all the
surprise of the multitude, and was even the loudest of them all in
invectives against the envoys; denouncing Lacedæmonian perfidy and
evil designs in language far more bitter than he had ever employed
before. Nor was this all:<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73"
class="fnanchor">[73]</a> he took advantage of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_48">[p. 48]</span> the vehement acclamation which welcomed
these invectives to propose that the Argeian envoys should be
called in and the alliance with Argos concluded forthwith. And
this would certainly have been done, if a remarkable phenomenon—an
earthquake—had not occurred to prevent it; causing the assembly to
be adjourned to the next day, pursuant to a religious scruple then
recognized as paramount.</p>

<p>This remarkable anecdote comes in all its main circumstances from
Thucydidês. It illustrates forcibly that unprincipled character which
will be found to attach to Alkibiadês through life, and presents
indeed an unblushing combination of impudence and fraud, which we
cannot better describe than by saying that it is exactly in the vein
of Fielding’s Jonathan Wild. In depicting Kleon and Hyperbolus,
historians vie with each other in strong language to mark the
impudence which is said to have been their peculiar characteristic.
Now we have no particular facts before us to measure the amount
of truth in this, though as a general charge it is sufficiently
credible. But we may affirm, with full assurance, that none of
the much-decried demagogues of Athens—not one of those sellers of
leather, lamps, sheep, ropes, pollard, and other commodities, upon
whom Aristophanês heaps so many excellent jokes—ever surpassed, if
they ever equalled, the impudence of this descendant of Æakus and
Zeus in his manner of overreaching and disgracing the Lacedæmonian
envoys. These latter, it must be added, display a carelessness
of public faith and consistency, a facility in publicly unsaying
what they have just before publicly said, and a treachery towards
their own confidential agent, which is truly surprising, and goes
far to justify the general charge of habitual duplicity so often
alleged against the Lacedæmonian character.<a id="FNanchor_74"
href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The disgraced envoys would doubtless quit Athens immediately:
but this opportune earthquake gave Nikias a few hours to recover
from his unexpected overthrow. In the assembly of the next day,
he still contended that the friendship of Sparta was preferable
to that of Argos, and insisted on the prudence of postponing all
consummation of engagement with the latter until the real intentions
of Sparta, now so contradictory and inexplic<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_49">[p. 49]</span>able, should be made clear. He contended
that the position of Athens, in regard to the peace and alliance, was
that of superior honor and advantage; the position of Sparta, one of
comparative disgrace: Athens had thus a greater interest than Sparta
in maintaining what had been concluded. But he at the same time
admitted that a distinct and peremptory explanation must be exacted
from Sparta as to her intentions, and he requested the people to send
himself with some other colleagues to demand it. The Lacedæmonians
should be apprised that Argeian envoys were already present in
Athens with propositions, and that the Athenians might already have
concluded this alliance, if they could have permitted themselves to
do wrong to the existing alliance with Sparta. But the Lacedæmonians,
if their intentions were honorable, must show it forthwith: 1. By
restoring Panaktum, not demolished, but standing. 2. By restoring
Amphipolis also. 3. By renouncing their special alliance with the
Bœotians, unless the Bœotians on their side chose to become parties
to the peace with Athens.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75"
class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>The Athenian assembly, acquiescing in the recommendation of
Nikias, invested him with the commission which he required: a
remarkable proof, after the overpowering defeat of the preceding
day, how strong was the hold which he still retained upon them, and
how sincere their desire to keep on the best terms with Sparta. This
was a last chance granted to Nikias and his policy; a perfectly fair
chance, since all that was asked of Sparta was just; but it forced
him to bring matters to a decisive issue with her, and shut out
all farther evasion. His mission to Sparta failed altogether: the
influence of Kleobûlus and Xenarês, the anti-Athenian ephors, was
found predominant, so that not one of his demands was complied with.
And even when he formally announced that unless Sparta renounced
her special alliance with the Bœotians or compelled the Bœotians
to accept the peace with Athens, the Athenians would immediately
contract alliance with Argos, the menace produced no effect. He
could only obtain, and that too as a personal favor to himself,
that the oaths as they stood should be formally renewed; an empty
concession, which covered but faintly the humiliation of his retreat
to Athens.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[p. 50]</span> The
Athenian assembly listened to his report with strong indignation
against the Lacedæmonians, and with marked displeasure even against
himself, as the great author and voucher of this unperformed treaty;
while Alkibiadês was permitted to introduce the envoys—already
at hand in the city—from Argos, Mantineia, and Elis, with whom a
pact was at once concluded.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76"
class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>The words of this, which Thucydidês gives us doubtless from the
record on the public column, comprise two engagements; one for peace,
another for alliance.</p>

<p>The Athenians, Argeians, Mantineians, and Eleians, have concluded
a treaty of peace by sea and by land, without fraud or mischief, each
for themselves and for the allies over whom each exercise empire.<a
id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> [The
express terms in which these states announce themselves as imperial
states and their allies as dependencies, deserve notice. No such
words appear in the treaty between Athens and Lacedæmon. I have
already mentioned that the main ground of discontent on the part of
Mantineia and Elis towards Sparta, was connected with their imperial
power.]</p>

<p>Neither of them shall bear arms against the other for purposes of
damage.</p>

<p>The Athenians, Argeians, Mantineians, and Eleians, shall be allies
with each other for one hundred years. If any enemy shall invade
Attica, the three contracting cities shall lend the most vigorous aid
in their power at the invitation of Athens. Should the forces of the
invading city damage Attica and then retire, the three will proclaim
that city their enemy and attack it: neither of the four shall in
that case suspend the war, without consent of the others.</p>

<p>Reciprocal obligations imposed upon Athens, in case Argos, Mantineia,
or Elis, shall be attacked.</p>

<p>Neither of the four contracting powers shall grant passage to
troops through their own territory, or the territory of allies
over whom they may at the time be exercising command, either by
land or sea, unless upon joint resolution.<a id="FNanchor_78"
href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[p. 51]</span></p> <p>In case
auxiliary troops shall be required and sent under this treaty, the
city sending shall furnish their maintenance for the space of thirty
days, from the day of their entrance upon the territory of the city
requiring. Should their services be needed for a longer period, the
city requiring shall furnish their maintenance, at the rate of three
Æginæan oboli for each hoplite, light-armed or archer, and of one
Æginæan drachma or six oboli for each horseman, per day. The city
requiring shall possess the command, so long as the service required
shall be in her territory. But if any expedition shall be undertaken
by joint resolution, then the command shall be shared equally between
all.</p>

<p>Such were the substantive conditions of the new alliance.
Provision was then made for the oaths,—by whom? where? when? in what
words? how often? they were to be taken. Athens was to swear on
behalf of herself and her allies; but Argos, Elis, and Mantineia,
with their respective allies, were to swear by separate cities. The
oaths were to be renewed every four years; by Athens, within thirty
days before each Olympic festival, at Argos, Elis, and Mantineia; by
these three cities, at Athens, ten days before each festival of the
greater Panathenæa. “The words of the treaty of peace and alliance,
and the oaths sworn, shall be engraven on stone columns, and put up
in the temples of each of the four cities; and also upon a brazen
column, to be put up by joint cost at Olympia, for the festival now
approaching.”</p>

<p>“The four cities may, by joint consent, make any change
they please in the provisions of this treaty, without
violating their oaths.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79"
class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>The conclusion of this new treaty introduced a greater degree of
complication into the grouping and association of the Grecian cities
than had ever before been known. The ancient Spartan confederacy, and
the Athenian empire still subsisted. A peace<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_52">[p. 52]</span> had been concluded between them,
ratified by the formal vote of the majority of the confederates,
yet not accepted by several of the minority. Not merely peace,
but also special alliance had been concluded between Athens and
Sparta; and a special alliance between Sparta and Bœotia. Corinth,
member of the Spartan confederacy, was also member of a defensive
alliance with Argos, Mantineia, and Elis; which three states had
concluded a more intimate alliance, first with each other (without
Corinth), and now recently with Athens. Yet both Athens and Sparta
still retained the alliance<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80"
class="fnanchor">[80]</a> concluded between themselves, without
formal rupture on either side, though Athens still complained that
the treaty had not been fulfilled. No relations whatever subsisted
between Argos and Sparta. Between Athens and Bœotia there was an
armistice terminable at ten days’ notice. Lastly, Corinth could
not be prevailed upon, in spite of repeated solicitation from
the Argeians, to join the new alliance of Athens with Argos: so
that no relations subsisted between Corinth and Athens; while
the Corinthians began, though faintly, to resume their former
tendencies towards Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81"
class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>The alliance between Athens and Argos, of which particulars have
just been given, was concluded not long before the Olympic festival
of the 90th Olympiad, or 420 <small>B.C.</small>: the
festival being about the beginning of July, the treaty might be in
May.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
That festival was memorable, on more than one ground. It was
the first which had been celebrated since the conclusion of the
peace, the leading clause of which had been expressly introduced
to guarantee to all Greeks free access to the great Pan-Hellenic
temples, with liberty of sacrificing, consulting the oracle, and
witnessing the matches. For the last eleven years, including
two Olympic festivals, Athens herself, and apparently all the
numerous allies of Athens, had been excluded from sending their
solemn legation, or theôry, and from attending as spectators,
at the Olympic games.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83"
class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Now that such exclusion was removed,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[p. 53]</span> and that the Eleian
heralds (who came to announce the approaching games and proclaim
the truce connected with them) again trod the soil of Attica,—the
Athenian visit was felt both by themselves and by others as a
novelty. Some curiosity was entertained to see what figure the theôry
of Athens would make as to show and splendor. Nor were there wanting
spiteful rumors, that Athens had been so much impoverished by the
war, as to be prevented from appearing with appropriate magnificence
at the altar and in the presence of Olympic Zeus.</p>

<p>Alkibiadês took pride in silencing these surmises, as well as
in glorifying his own name and person, by a display more imposing
than had ever been previously beheld. He had already distinguished
himself in the local festivals and liturgies of Athens by an
ostentation surpassing Athenian rivals: but he now felt himself
standing forward as the champion and leader of Athens before
Greece. He had discredited his political rival Nikias, given a new
direction to the politics of Athens by the Argeian alliance, and
was about to commence a series of intra-Peloponnesian operations
against the Lacedæmonians. On all these grounds he determined that
his first appearance on the plain of Olympia should impose upon all
beholders. The Athenian theôry, of which he was a member, was set
out with first-rate splendor, and with the amplest show of golden
ewers, censers, etc., for the public sacrifice and procession.<a
id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
But when the chariot-races came on, Alkibiadês himself appeared
as competitor at his own cost,—not merely with one well-equipped
chariot and four, which the richest Greeks had hitherto counted as
an extra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[p. 54]</span>ordinary
personal glory, but with the prodigious number of seven distinct
chariots, each with a team of four horses. And so superior was their
quality, that one of his chariots gained a first prize, and another
a second prize, so that Alkibiadês was twice crowned with sprigs of
the sacred olive-tree, and twice proclaimed by the herald. Another of
his seven chariots also came in fourth: but no crown or proclamation,
it seems, was awarded to any after the second in order. We must
recollect that he had competitors from all parts of Greece to contend
against, not merely private men, but even despots and governments.
Nor was this all. The tent which the Athenian theôrs provided for
their countrymen, visitors to the games, was handsomely adorned;
but a separate tent, which Alkibiadês himself provided for a public
banquet to celebrate his triumph, together with the banquet itself,
was set forth on a scale still more stately and expensive. The rich
allies of Athens—Ephesus, Chios, and Lesbos—are said to have lent him
their aid in enhancing this display. It is highly probable that they
would be glad to cultivate his favor, as he had now become one of
the first men in Athens, and was in an ascendent course. But we must
farther recollect that they, as well as Athens, had been excluded
from the Olympic festival, so that their own feelings on first
returning might well prompt them to take a genuine interest in this
imposing reappearance of the Ionic race at the common sanctuary of
Hellas.</p>

<p>Five years afterwards, on an important discussion which will
be hereafter described, Alkibiadês maintained publicly before the
Athenian assembly that his unparalleled Olympic display had produced
an effect upon the Grecian mind highly beneficial to Athens;<a
id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[p. 55]</span> dissipating the
suspicions entertained that she was ruined by the war, and
establishing beyond dispute her vast wealth and power.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[p. 56]</span> He was doubtless right
to a considerable extent; though not sufficient to repel the
charge from himself, which it was his pur<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_57">[p. 57]</span>pose to do, both of overweening personal
vanity, and of that reckless expenditure which he would be compelled
to try and overtake by peculation or violence at the public cost. All
the unfavorable impressions suggested to prudent Athenians by his
previous life, were aggravated by this stupendous display; much more,
of course, the jealousy and hatred of personal competitors. And this
feeling was not the less real, though as a political man he was now
in the full tide of public favor.</p>

<p>If the festival of the 90th Olympiad was peculiarly distinguished
by the reappearance of Athenians and those connected with them, it
was marked by a farther novelty yet more striking, the exclusion of
the Lacedæmonians. This exclusion was the consequence of the new
political interests of the Eleians, combined with their increased
consciousness of force arising out of the recent alliance with Argos,
Athens, and Mantineia. It has already been mentioned that since the
peace with Athens, the Lacedæmonians, acting as arbitrators in the
case of Lepreum, which the Eleians claimed as their dependency,
had declared it to be autonomous, and had sent a body of troops to
defend it. Probably the Eleians had recently renewed their attacks
upon the district, since the junction with their new allies;
for the Lacedæmonians had detached thither a fresh body of one
thousand hoplites immediately prior to the Olympic festival. Out
of the mission of this fresh detachment the sentence of exclusion
arose. The Eleians were privileged administrators of the festival,
regulating the details of the ceremony itself, and formally<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[p. 58]</span> proclaiming by heralds
the commencement of the Olympic truce during which all violation
of the Eleian territory by an armed force was a sin against the
majesty of Zeus. On the present occasion they affirmed that the
Lacedæmonians had sent the one thousand hoplites into Lepreum, and
had captured a fort called Phyrkus, both Eleian possessions, after
the proclamation of the truce. They accordingly imposed upon Sparta
the fine prescribed by the “Olympian law,” of two minæ for each man,
two thousand minæ in all; a part to Zeus Olympius, a part to the
Eleians themselves. During the interval between the proclamation of
the truce and the commencement of the festival, the Lacedæmonians
sent to remonstrate against this fine, which they alleged to have
been unjustly imposed, inasmuch as the heralds had not yet proclaimed
the truce at Sparta when the hoplites reached Lepreum. The Eleians
replied that the truce had already at that time been proclaimed among
themselves (for they always proclaimed it first at home, before
their heralds crossed the borders), so that <i>they</i> were interdicted
from all military operations; of which the Lacedæmonian hoplites
had taken advantage to commit their last aggressions. To which the
Lacedæmonians rejoined, that the behavior of the Eleians themselves
contradicted their own allegation, for they had sent the Eleian
heralds to Sparta to proclaim the truce after they knew of the
sending of the hoplites, thus showing that they did not consider the
truce to have been already violated. The Lacedæmonians added, that
after the herald reached Sparta, they had taken no farther military
measures. How the truth stood in this disputed question, we have no
means of deciding. But the Eleians rejected the explanation, though
offering, if the Lacedæmonians would restore to them Lepreum, to
forego such part of the fine as would accrue to themselves, and to
pay out of their own treasury on behalf of the Lacedæmonians the
portion which belonged to the god. This new proposition being alike
refused, was again modified by the Eleians. They intimated that they
would be satisfied if the Lacedæmonians, instead of paying the fine
at once, would publicly on the altar at Olympia, in presence of the
assembled Greeks, take an oath to pay it at a future date. But the
Lacedæmonians would not listen to the proposition either of payment
or of promise. Accordingly the Eleians, as judges under the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[p. 59]</span> Olympic law, interdicted
them from the temple of Olympic Zeus, from the privilege of
sacrificing there, and from attendance and competition at the games;
that is, from attendance in the form of the sacred legation called
theôry, occupying a formal and recognized place at the solemnity.<a
id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>As all the other Grecian states—with the single exception
of Lepreum—were present by their theôries<a id="FNanchor_87"
href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> as well as by
individual spectators, so the Spartan theôry “shone by its absence”
in a manner painfully and insultingly conspicuous. So extreme,
indeed, was the affront put upon the Lacedæmonians, connected as they
were with Olympia by a tie ancient, peculiar, and never yet broken;
so pointed the evidence of that comparative degradation into which
they had fallen, through the peace with Athens coming at the back
of the Sphakterian disaster,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88"
class="fnanchor">[88]</a> that they were supposed likely to set the
exclusion at defiance; and to escort their theôrs into the temple at
Olympia for sacrifice, under the protection of an armed force. The
Eleians even thought it necessary to put their younger hoplites under
arms, and to summon to their aid one thousand hoplites from Mantineia
as well as the same number from Argos, for the purpose of repelling
this probable attack: while a detachment of Athenian cavalry were
stationed at Argos during the festival, to lend assistance in case
of need. The alarm prevalent among the spectators of the festival
was most serious, and became considerably aggravated by an incident
which occurred after the chariot racing. Lichas,<a id="FNanchor_89"
href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> a Lacedæmonian of
great wealth and consequence, had a chariot running in the lists,
which he was obliged to enter, not in his own name, but in the name
of the Bœotian federation. The sentence of exclusion hindered him
from taking any ostensible part, but it did not hinder him from
being present as a spectator; and when he saw his chariot proclaimed
victorious under the title of Bœotian, his impatience to make himself
known became uncontrol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[p.
60]</span>lable. He stepped into the midst of the lists, and placed
a chaplet on the head of the charioteer, thus advertising himself
as the master. This was a flagrant indecorum and known violation
of the order of the festival: accordingly, the official attendants
with their staffs interfered at once in performance of their
duty, chastising and driving him back to his place with blows.<a
id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Hence
arose an increased apprehension of armed Lacedæmonian interference.
None such took place, however: the Lacedæmonians, for the first
and last time in their history, offered their Olympic sacrifice
at home, and the festival passed off without any interruption.<a
id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
The boldness of the Eleians in putting this affront upon the most
powerful state in Greece is so astonishing, that we can hardly be
mistaken in supposing their proceeding to have been suggested by
Alkibiadês and encouraged by the armed aid from the allies. He was
at this moment not less ostentatious in humiliating Sparta than in
showing off Athens.</p>

<p>Of the depressed influence and estimation of Sparta, a farther
proof was soon afforded by the fate of her colony, the Trachinian
Herakleia, established near Thermopylæ, in the third year of the war.
That colony—though at first comprising a numerous body of settlers,
in consequence of the general trust in Lacedæmonian power, and though
always under the government of a Lacedæmonian harmost—had never
prospered. It had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[p. 61]</span>
been persecuted from the beginning by the neighboring tribes, and
administered with harshness as well as peculation by its governors.
The establishment of the town had been regarded from the beginning by
the neighbors, especially the Thessalians, as an invasion of their
territory; and their hostilities, always vexatious, had, in the
winter succeeding the Olympic festival just described, been carried
to a greater point of violence than ever. They had defeated the
Herakleots in a ruinous battle, and slain Xenarês the Lacedæmonian
governor. But though the place was so reduced as to be unable to
maintain itself without foreign aid, Sparta was too much embarrassed
by Peloponnesian enemies and waverers to be able to succor it; and
the Bœotians, observing her inability, became apprehensive that the
interference of Athens would be invoked. Accordingly they thought it
prudent to occupy Herakleia with a body of Bœotian troops, dismissing
the Lacedæmonian governor Hegesippidas for alleged misconduct.
Nor could the Lacedæmonians prevent this proceeding, though it
occasioned them to make indignant remonstrance.<a id="FNanchor_92"

  FROM THE FESTIVAL OF OLYMPIAD NINETY DOWN TO THE BATTLE OF
  MANTINEIA.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Shortly</span>
after the remarkable events of the Olympic festival described in my
last chapter, the Argeians and their allies sent a fresh embassy to
invite the Corinthians to join them. They thought it a promising
opportunity, after the affront just put upon Sparta, to prevail upon
the Corinthians to desert her: but Spartan envoys were present also,
and though the discussions were much protracted, no new resolution
was adopted. An<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[p. 62]</span>
earthquake—possibly an earthquake not real, but simulated for
convenience—abruptly terminated the congress. The Corinthians—though
seemingly distrusting Argos, now that she was united with Athens,
and leaning rather towards Sparta—were unwilling to pronounce
themselves in favor of one so as to make an enemy of the other.<a
id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>In spite of this first failure, the new alliance of Athens and
Argos manifested its fruits vigorously in the ensuing spring. Under
the inspirations of Alkibiadês, Athens was about to attempt the
new experiment of seeking to obtain intra-Peloponnesian followers
and influence. At the beginning of the war, she had been maritime,
defensive, and simply conservative, under the guidance of Periklês.
After the events of Sphakteria, she made use of that great advantage
to aim at the recovery of Megara and Bœotia, which she had before
been compelled to abandon by the thirty years’ truce, at the
recommendation of Kleon. In this attempt she employed the eighth
year of the war, but with signal ill-success; while Brasidas during
that period broke open the gates of her maritime empire, and robbed
her of many important dependencies. The grand object of Athens then
became, to recover these lost dependencies, especially Amphipolis:
Nikias and his partisans sought to effect such recovery by making
peace, while Kleon and his supporters insisted that it could never
be achieved except by military efforts. The expedition under Kleon
against Amphipolis had failed, the peace concluded by Nikias had
failed also: Athens had surrendered her capital advantage, without
regaining Amphipolis; and if she wished to regain it, there was no
alternative except to repeat the attempt which had failed under
Kleon. And this perhaps she might have done, as we shall find her
projecting to do in the course of about four years forward, if it
had not been, first, that the Athenian mind was now probably sick
and disheartened about Amphipolis, in consequence of the prodigious
disgrace so recently undergone there; next, that Alkibiadês, the
new chief adviser or prime minister of Athens—if we may be allowed
to use an inaccurate expression, which yet suggests the reality of
the case—was prompted by his personal impulses to turn the stream of
Athe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[p. 63]</span>nian ardor into
a different channel. Full of antipathy to Sparta, he regarded the
interior of Peloponnesus as her most vulnerable point, especially in
the present disjointed relations of its component cities. Moreover,
his personal thirst for glory was better gratified amidst the centre
of Grecian life than by undertaking an expedition into a distant and
barbarous region: lastly, he probably recollected with discomfort
the hardships and extreme cold, insupportable to all except the iron
frame of Sokrates, which he had himself endured at the blockade of
Potidæa twelve years before,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94"
class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and which any armament destined to conquer
Amphipolis would have to go through again. It was under these
impressions that he now began to press his intra-Peloponnesian
operations against Lacedæmon, with the view of organizing a
counter-alliance under Argos sufficient to keep her in check, and
at any rate to nullify her power of carrying invasion beyond the
Isthmus. All this was to be done without ostensibly breaking the
peace and alliance between Athens and Lacedæmon, which stood in
conspicuous letters on pillars erected in both cities.</p>

<p>Coming to Argos at the head of a few Athenian hoplites and bowmen,
and reinforced by Peloponnesian allies, Alkibiadês exhibited the
spectacle of an Athenian general traversing the interior of the
peninsula, and imposing his own arrangements in various quarters,
a spectacle at that moment new and striking.<a id="FNanchor_95"
href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> He first turned his
attention to the Achæan towns in the northwest, where he persuaded
the inhabitants of Patræ to ally themselves with Athens, and even to
undertake the labor of connecting their town with the sea by means of
long walls, so as to place themselves within the protection of Athens
from seaward. He farther projected the erection of a fort and the
formation of a naval station at the extreme point of Cape Rhium, just
at the narrow entrance of the Corinthian gulf; whereby the Athenians,
who already possessed the opposite shore by means of Naupaktus,
would have become masters of the commerce of the gulf.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[p. 64]</span> But the Corinthians
and Sikyonians, to whom this would have been a serious mischief,
despatched forces enough to prevent the consummation of the scheme,
and probably also to hinder the erection of the walls at Patræ.<a
id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Yet
the march of Alkibiadês doubtless strengthened the anti-Laconian
interest throughout the Achæan coast.</p>

<p>He then returned to take part with the Argeians in a war against
Epidaurus. To acquire possession of this city would much facilitate
the communication between Athens and Argos, since it was not
only immediately opposite to the island of Ægina now occupied by
the Athenians, but also opened to the latter an access by land,
dispensing with the labor of circumnavigating Cape Skyllæum, the
southeastern point of the Argeian and Epidaurian peninsula, whenever
they sent forces to Argos. Moreover, the territory of Epidaurus
bordered to the north on that of Corinth, so that the possession
of it would be an additional guarantee for the neutrality of the
Corinthians. Accordingly it was resolved to attack Epidaurus, for
which a pretext was easily found. As presiding and administering
state of the temple of Apollo Pythäeus (situated within the walls
of Argos), the Argeians enjoyed a sort of religious supremacy over
Epidaurus and other neighboring cities, seemingly the remnant of
that extensive supremacy, political as well as religious, which in
early times had been theirs.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97"
class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The Epidaurians owed to this temple certain
sacrifices and other ceremonial obligations, one of which, arising
out of some circumstance which we cannot understand, was now due and
unperformed: at least so the Argeians alleged. Such default imposed
upon them the duty of getting together a military force to attack the
Epidaurians and enforce the obligation.</p>

<p>Their invading march, however, was for a time suspended by the
news that king Agis with the full force of Lacedæmon and her allies
had advanced as far as Leuktra, one of the border towns of Laconia
on the northwest, towards Mount Lykæum and the Arcadian Parrhasii.
What this movement meant was known only to Agis himself, who did not
even explain the purpose to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[p.
65]</span> his own soldiers or officers, or allies.<a
id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> But
the sacrifice constantly offered before passing the border was
found so unfavorable, that he abandoned his march for the present
and returned home. The month Karneius, a period of truce as well as
religious festival among the Dorian states, being now at hand, he
directed the allies to hold themselves prepared for an out-march as
soon as that month had expired.</p>

<p>On being informed that Agis had dismissed his troops, the
Argeians prepared to execute their invasion of Epidaurus. The day
on which they set out was already the twenty-sixth of the month
preceding the Karneian month, so that there remained only three
days before the commencement of that latter month with its holy
truce, binding upon the religious feelings of the Dorian states
generally, to which Argos, Sparta, and Epidaurus all belonged. But
the Argeians made use of that very peculiarity of the season, which
was accounted likely to keep them at home, to facilitate their
scheme, by playing a trick with the calendar, and proclaiming one
of those arbitrary interferences with the reckoning of time which
the Greeks occasionally employed to correct the ever-recurring
confusion of their lunar system. Having begun their march on the
twenty-sixth of the month before Karneius, the Argeians called each
succeeding day still the twenty-sixth, thus disallowing the lapse of
time, and pretending that the Karneian month had not yet commenced.
This proceeding was farther facilitated by the circumstance, that
their allies of Athens, Elis, and Mantineia, not being Dorians, were
under no obligation to observe the Karneian truce. Accordingly,
the army marched from Argos into the territory of Epidaurus, and
spent seemingly a fortnight or three weeks in laying it waste; all
this time being really, according to the reckoning of the other
Dorian states, part of the Karneian truce, which the Argeians,
adopting their own arbitrary computation of time, professed not to
be violating. The Epidaurians, unable to meet them single-handed in
the field,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[p. 66]</span> invoked
the aid of their allies: who, however, had already been summoned by
Sparta for the succeeding month, and did not choose, any more than
the Spartans, to move during the Karneian month itself. Some allies,
however, perhaps the Corinthians, came as far as the Epidaurian
border, but did not feel themselves strong enough to lend aid by
entering the territory alone.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99"
class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_67">[p. 67]</span></p> <p>Meanwhile the Athenians had
convoked another congress of deputies at Mantineia, for the purpose
of discussing propositions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[p.
68]</span> of peace: perhaps this may have been a point carried
by Nikias at Athens, in spite of Alkibiadês. What other deputies
attended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[p. 69]</span> we are not
told; but Euphamidas, coming as envoy from Corinth, animadverted even
at the opening of the debates upon the inconsistency of assembling
a peace congress while war was actually raging in the Epidaurian
territory. So much were the Athenian deputies struck with this
observation, that they departed, persuaded the Argeians to retire
from Epidaurus, and then came back to resume negotiations. Still,
however, the pretensions of both parties were found irreconcilable,
and the congress broke up; upon which the Argeians again returned
to renew their devastation in Epidaurus, while the Lacedæmonians,
immediately on the expiration of the Karneian month, marched out
again, as far as their border town of Karyæ, but were again arrested
and forced to return by unfavorable border-sacrifices. Intimation
of their out-march, however, was transmitted to Athens; upon which
Alkibiadês, at the head of one thousand Athenian hoplites, was sent
to join the Argeians. But before he arrived, the Lacedæmonian army
had been already disbanded; so that his services were no longer
required, and the Argeians carried their ravages over one-third of
the territory of Epidaurus before they at length evacuated it.<a
id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[p. 70]</span></p> <p>The
Epidaurians were reinforced about the end of September by a
detachment of three hundred Lacedæmonian hoplites under Agesippidas,
sent by sea without the knowledge of the Athenians. Of this, the
Argeians preferred loud complaints at Athens; and they had good
reason to condemn the negligence of the Athenians as allies, for not
having kept better naval watch at their neighboring station of Ægina,
and for having allowed this enemy to enter the harbor of Epidaurus.
But they took another ground of complaint, somewhat remarkable. In
the alliance between Athens, Argos, Elis, and Mantineia, it had been
stipulated that neither of the four should suffer the passage of
troops through its territory, without the joint consent of all. Now
the sea was accounted a part of the territory of Athens: so that the
Athenians had violated this article of the treaty by permitting the
Lacedæmonians to send troops by sea to Epidaurus. And the Argeians
now required Athens, in compensation for this wrong, to carry back
the Messenians and Helots from Kephallenia to Pylos, and allow
them to ravage Laconia. The Athenians, under the persuasion of
Alkibiadês, complied with their requisition; inscribing, at the foot
of the pillar on which their alliance with Sparta stood recorded,
that the Lacedæmonians had not observed their oaths. Nevertheless,
they still abstained from formally throwing up their treaty with
Lacedæmon, or breaking it in any other way.<a id="FNanchor_101"
href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The relations between
Athens and Sparta thus remained in name, peace and alliance, so far
as concerns direct operations against each other’s territory; in
reality, hostile action as well as hostile manœuvring, against each
other, as allies respectively of third parties.</p>

<p>The Argeians, after having prolonged their incursions on the
Epidaurian territory throughout all the autumn, made in the winter
an unavailing attempt to take the town itself by storm. Though there
was no considerable action, but merely a succession of desultory
attacks, in some of which the Epidaurians even<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_71">[p. 71]</span> had the advantage, yet they still
suffered serious hardship, and pressed their case forcibly on the
sympathy of Sparta. Thus importuned, and mortified as well as
alarmed by the increasing defection or coldness which they now
experienced throughout Peloponnesus, the Lacedæmonians determined
during the course of the ensuing summer to put forth their strength
vigorously, and win back their lost ground.<a id="FNanchor_102"
href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Towards the month of June (<small>B.C.</small> 418)
they marched with their full force, freemen as well as Helots,
under king Agis, against Argos. The Tegeans and other Arcadian
allies joined them on the march, while their other allies near the
Isthmus,—Bœotians, Megarians, Corinthians, Sikyonians, Phliasians,
etc., were directed to assemble at Phlius. The number of these latter
allies were very considerable, for we hear of five thousand Bœotian
hoplites, and two thousand Corinthian: the Bœotians had with them
also five thousand light-armed, five hundred horsemen, and five
hundred foot-soldiers, who ran alongside of the horsemen. The numbers
of the rest, or of Spartans themselves, we do not know; nor probably
did Thucydidês himself know: for we find him remarking elsewhere the
impenetrable concealment of the Lacedæmonians on all public affairs,
in reference to the numbers at the subsequent battle of Mantineia.
Such muster of the Lacedæmonian alliance was no secret to the
Argeians, who marching first to Mantineia, and there taking up the
force of that city as well as three thousand Eleian hoplites who came
to join them, met the Lacedæmonians in their march at Methydrium in
Arcadia. The two armies being posted on opposite hills, the Argeians
had resolved to attack Agis the next day, so as to prevent him from
joining his allies at Phlius. But he eluded this separate encounter
by decamping in the night, reached Phlius, and operated his junction
in safety. We do not hear that there was in the Lacedæmonian army
any commander of lochus, who, copying the unreasonable punctilio of
Amompharetus before the battle of Platæa, refused to obey the order
of retreat before the enemy, to the imminent risk of the whole army.
And the fact, that no similar incident occurred now, may be held to
prove that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[p. 72]</span> the
Lacedæmonians had acquired greater familiarity with the exigencies of
actual warfare.</p>

<p>As soon as the Lacedæmonian retreat was known in the morning,
the Argeians left their position also, and marched with their
allies, first to Argos itself; next, to Nemea, on the ordinary road
from Corinth and Phlius to Argos, by which they imagined that the
invaders would approach. But Agis acted differently. Distributing
his force into three divisions, he himself with the Lacedæmonians
and Arcadians, taking a short, but very rugged and difficult road,
crossed the ridge of the mountains and descended straight into the
plain near Argos. The Corinthians, Pellenians, and Phliasians, were
directed to follow another mountain road, which entered the same
plain upon a different point; while the Bœotians, Corinthians, and
Sikyonians, followed the longer, more even, and more ordinary route,
by Nemea. This route, though apparently frequented and convenient,
led for a considerable distance along a narrow ravine, called the
Trêtus, bounded on each side by mountains. The united army under Agis
was much superior in number to the Argeians: but if all had marched
in one line by the frequented route through the narrow Trêtus,
their superiority of number would have been of little use, whilst
the Argeians would have had a position highly favorable to their
defence. By dividing his force, and taking the mountain road with his
own division, Agis got into the plain of Argos in the rear of the
Argeian position at Nemea. He anticipated that when the Argeians saw
him devastating their properties near the city, they would forthwith
quit the advantageous ground near Nemea, to come and attack him in
the plain: the Bœotian division would thus find the road by Nemea
and the Trêtus open, and would be able to march without resistance
into the plain of Argos, where their numerous cavalry would act with
effect against the Argeians engaged in attacking Agis. This triple
march was executed. Agis with his division, and the Corinthians with
theirs, got across the mountains into the Argeian plain during the
night; while the Argeians,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103"
class="fnanchor">[103]</a> hearing at daybreak that he was near
their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[p. 73]</span> city,
ravaging Saminthus and other places, left their position at Nemea
to come down to the plain and attack him. In their march they had a
partial skirmish with the Corinthian division, which had reached a
high ground immediately above the Argeian plain, and which lay nearly
in the road. But this affair was indecisive, and they soon found
themselves in the plain near to Agis and the Lacedæmonians, who lay
between them and their city.</p>

<p>On both sides, the armies were marshalled, and order taken for
battle. But the situation of the Argeians was in reality little
less than desperate: for while they had Agis and his division in
their front, the Corinthian detachment was near enough to take
them in flank, and the Bœotians marching along the undefended road
through the Trêtus would attack them in the rear. The Bœotian
cavalry too would act with full effect upon them in the plain, since
neither Argos, Elis, nor Mantineia, seemed to have possessed any
horsemen; a description of force which ought to have been sent from
Athens, though from some cause which does not appear, the Athenian
contingent had not yet arrived. Nevertheless, in spite of this very
critical position, both the Argeians and their allies were elate
with confidence and impatient for battle; thinking only of the
division of Agis immediately in their front, which appeared to be
inclosed between them and their city, and taking no heed to the other
formidable enemies in their flank and rear. But the Argeian generals
were better aware than their soldiers of the real danger; and just
as the two armies were about to charge, Alkiphron, proxenus of the
Lacedæmonians at Argos, accompanied Thrasyllus, one of the five
generals of the Argeians, to a separate parley with Agis, without
the least consultation or privity on the part of their own army.
They exhorted Agis not to force on a battle, assuring him that the
Argeians were ready both to give and receive equitable satisfaction,
in all matters of complaint which the Lacedæmonians might urge
against them, and to conclude a just peace for the future. Agis,
at once acquiescing in the proposal, granted them a truce of four
months to accomplish what they had promised. He on his part also took
this step without consulting either his army or his allies, simply
addressing a few words of confidential talk to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_74">[p. 74]</span> one of the official Spartans near him.
Immediately, he gave the order for retreat, and the army, instead
of being led to battle, was conducted out of the Argeian territory,
through the Nemean road whereby the Bœotians had just been entering.
But it required all the habitual discipline of Lacedæmonian
soldiers to make them obey this order of the Spartan king, alike
unexpected and unwelcome.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104"
class="fnanchor">[104]</a> For the army were fully sensible both of
the prodigious advantages of their position, and of the overwhelming
strength of the invading force, so that all the three divisions
were loud in their denunciations of Agis, and penetrated with shame
at the thoughts of so disgraceful a retreat. And when they all saw
themselves in one united body at Nemea, previous to breaking up and
going home,—so as to have before their eyes their own full numbers
and the complete equipment of one of the finest Hellenic armies which
had ever been assembled,—the Argeian body of allies, before whom they
were now retiring, appeared contemptible in the comparison, and they
separated with yet warmer and more universal indignation against the
king who had betrayed their cause.</p>

<p>On returning home, Agis incurred not less blame from the Spartan
authorities than from his own army, for having thrown away so
admirable an opportunity of subduing Argos. This was assuredly no
more than he deserved: but we read with no small astonishment that
the Argeians and their allies on returning were even more exasperated
against Thrasyllus,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105"
class="fnanchor">[105]</a> whom they accused of having traitorously
thrown away a certain victory. They had indeed good ground, in the
received practice, to censure him for having concluded a truce
without taking the sense of the people. It was their custom on
returning from a march, to hold a public court-martial before
entering the city, at a place called the Charadrus, or winter torrent
near the walls, for the purpose of adjudicating on offences and
faults committed in the army. Such was their wrath on this occasion
against Thrasyllus, that they would scarcely be prevailed upon even
to put him upon his trial, but began to stone him. He was forced
to seek personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[p. 75]</span>
safety at the altar; upon which the soldiers tried him, and he was
condemned to have his property confiscated.<a id="FNanchor_106"
href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Very shortly afterwards the expected Athenian contingent arrived,
which probably ought to have come earlier: one thousand hoplites,
with three hundred horsemen, under Lachês and Nikostratus. Alkibiadês
came as ambassador, probably serving as a soldier also among the
horsemen. The Argeians, notwithstanding their displeasure against
Thrasyllus, nevertheless felt themselves pledged to observe the truce
which he had concluded, and their magistrates accordingly desired the
newly-arrived Athenians to depart. Nor was Alkibiadês even permitted
to approach and address the public assembly, until the Mantineian and
Eleian allies insisted that thus much at least should not be refused.
An assembly was therefore convened, in which these allies took part,
along with the Argeians. Alkibiadês contended strenuously that the
recent truce with the Lacedæmonians was null and void; since it had
been contracted without the privity of all the allies, distinctly at
variance with the terms of the alliance. He therefore called upon
them to resume military operations forthwith, in conjunction with
the reinforcement now seasonably arrived. His speech so persuaded
the assembly, that the Mantineians and Eleians consented at once to
join him in an expedition against the Arcadian town of Orchomenus;
the Argeians, also, though at first reluctant, very speedily followed
them thither. Orchomenus was a place important to acquire, not merely
because its territory joined that of Mantineia on the northward, but
because the Lacedæmonians had deposited therein the hostages which
they had taken from Arcadian townships and villages as guarantee
for fidelity. Its walls were however in bad condition, and its
inhabitants, after a short resistance, capitulated. They agreed
to become allies of Mantineia, to furnish hostages for faithful
adhesion to such alliance, and to deliver up the hostages deposited
with them by Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107"
class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Encouraged by first success, the allies debated what they should
next undertake; the Eleians contending strenuously for a march
against Lepreum, while the Mantineians were anxious to attack
their enemy and neighbor Tegea. The Argeians and Athenians<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[p. 76]</span> preferred the latter,
incomparably the more important enterprise of the two: but
such was the disgust of the Eleians at the rejection of their
proposition, that they abandoned the army altogether, and went home.
Notwithstanding their desertion, however, the remaining allies
continued together at Mantineia, organizing their attack upon Tegea,
in which city they had a strong favorable party, who had actually
laid their plans, and were on the point of proclaiming the revolt
of the city from Sparta,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108"
class="fnanchor">[108]</a> when the philo-Laconian Tegeans just
saved themselves by despatching the most urgent message to Sparta,
and receiving the most rapid succor. The Lacedæmonians, filled with
indignation at the news of the surrender of Orchomenus, vented anew
all their displeasure against Agis, whom they now threatened with
the severe punishment of demolishing his house and fining him in
the sum of one hundred thousand drachmæ, or about twenty-seven and
two-thirds Attic talents. He urgently entreated that an opportunity
might be afforded to him of redeeming by some brave deed the ill name
which he had incurred: if he failed in doing so, then they might
inflict on him what penalty they chose. The penalty was accordingly
withdrawn: but a restriction, new to the Spartan constitution,
was now placed upon the authority of the king. It had been before
a part of his prerogative to lead out the army single-handed and
on his own authority; but a council of ten was now named, without
whose concurrence he was interdicted from exercising such power.<a
id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>To the great good fortune of Agis, a pressing message now arrived
announcing the imminent revolt of Tegea, the most important ally of
Sparta, and close upon her border. Such was the alarm occasioned by
this news that the whole military population instantly started off to
relieve the place, Agis at their head, the most rapid movement ever
known to have been made by Lacedæmonian soldiers.<a id="FNanchor_110"
href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> When they arrived at
Orestheium in Arcadia, in their way, perhaps hearing that the danger
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[p. 77]</span> somewhat less
pressing, they sent back to Sparta one-sixth part of the forces, for
home defence, the oldest as well as the youngest men. The remainder
marched forward to Tegea, where they were speedily joined by their
Arcadian allies. They farther sent messages to the Corinthians
and Bœotians, as well as to the Phocians and Lokrians, invoking
the immediate presence of these contingents in the territory of
Mantineia. The arrival of such reinforcements, however, even with
all possible zeal on the part of the cities contributing, could
not be looked for without some lapse of time; the rather, as it
appears, that they could not get into the territory of Mantineia
except by passing through that of Argos,<a id="FNanchor_111"
href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> which could not be
safely attempted until they had all formed a junction. Accordingly
Agis, impatient to redeem his reputation, marched at once with the
Lacedæmonians and the Arcadian allies present, into the territory
of Mantineia, and took up a position near the Herakleion, or
temple of Hêraklês,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112"
class="fnanchor">[112]</a> from whence he began to ravage the
neighboring lands. The Argeians and their allies presently came forth
from Mantineia, planted themselves near him, but on very rugged and
impracticable ground, and thus offered him battle. Nothing daunted
by the difficulties of the position, he marshalled his army and led
it up to attack them. His rashness on the present occasion might
have produced as much mischief as his inconsiderate concession to
Thrasyllus near Argos, had not an ancient Spartan called out to him
that he was now merely proceeding “to heal mischief by mischief.”
So forcibly was Agis impressed either with this timely admonition,
or by the closer view of the position which he had undertaken to
assault, that he suddenly halted the army and gave orders for
retreat, though actually within distance no greater than the cast of
a javelin from the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113"
class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[p. 78]</span></p>

<p>His march was now intended to draw the Argeians away from the
difficult ground which they occupied. On the frontier between
Mantineia and Tegea—both situated on a lofty but inclosed plain,
drained only by katabothra, or natural subterranean channels in the
mountains—was situated a head of water, the regular efflux of which
seems to have been kept up by joint operations of both cities for
their mutual benefit. Thither Agis now conducted his army, for the
purpose of turning the water towards the side of Mantineia, where
it would occasion serious damage; calculating that the Mantineians
and their allies would certainly descend from their position to
hinder it. No stratagem however was necessary to induce the latter
to adopt this resolution. For so soon as they saw the Lacedæmonians,
after advancing to the foot of the hill, first suddenly halt, next
retreat, and lastly disappear, their surprise was very great: and
this surprise was soon converted into contemptuous confidence and
impatience to pursue the flying enemy. The generals not sharing such
confidence, hesitated at first to quit their secure position: upon
which the troops became clamorous, and loudly denounced them for
treason in letting the Lacedæmonians quietly escape a second time,
as they had before done near Argos. These generals would probably
not be the same with those who had incurred, a short time before,
so much undeserved censure for their convention with Agis: but the
murmurs on the present occasion, hardly less unreasonable, drove
them, not without considerable shame and confusion, to give orders
for advance. They abandoned the hill, marched down into the plain
so as to approach the Lacedæmonians, and employed the next day in
arranging themselves in good battle order, so as to be ready to fight
at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it appears that Agis had found himself disappointed in
his operations upon the water. He had either not done so much damage,
or not spread so much terror, as he had expected: and he accordingly
desisted, putting himself again in march to resume his position
at the Herakleion, and supposing that his enemies still retained
their position on the hill. But in the course of this march he came
suddenly upon the Argeian and allied army where he was not in the
least prepared to see them: they were not only in the plain, but
already drawn up in perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[p.
79]</span> order of battle. The Mantineians occupied the right
wing, the post of honor, because the ground was in their territory:
next to them stood their dependent Arcadian allies: then the chosen
Thousand-regiment of Argos, citizens of wealth and family, trained
in arms at the cost of the state: alongside of them, the remaining
Argeian hoplites, with their dependent allies of Kleônæ and Orneæ:
last of all, on the left wing, stood the Athenians, their hoplites as
well as their horsemen.</p>

<p>It was with the greatest surprise that Agis and his army beheld
this unexpected apparition. To any other Greeks than Lacedæmonians,
the sudden presentation of a formidable enemy would have occasioned
a feeling of dismay from which they would have found it difficult
to recover; and even the Lacedæmonians, on this occasion, underwent
a momentary shock unparalleled in their previous experience.<a
id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> But
they now felt the full advantage of their rigorous training and habit
of military obedience, as well as of that subordination of officers
which was peculiar to themselves in Greece. In other Grecian armies
orders were proclaimed to the troops in a loud voice by a herald, who
received them personally from the general: each <i>taxis</i>, or company,
indeed, had its own taxiarch, but the latter did not receive his
orders separately from the general, and seems to have had no personal
responsibility for the execution of them by his soldiers. Subordinate
and responsible military authority was not recognized. Among the
Lacedæmonians, on the contrary, there was a regular gradation of
military and responsible authority, “commanders of commanders,” each
of whom had his special duty in insuring the execution of orders.<a
id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
Every order emanated from the Spartan king when he was present, and
was given to the polemarchs (each commanding a mora, the largest
military divis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[p. 80]</span>ion),
who intimated it to the lochagi, or colonels, of the respective
lochi. These again gave command to each pentekontêr, or captain
of a pentekosty; lastly, he to the enômotarch, who commanded the
lowest subdivision, called an enômoty. The soldier thus received
no immediate orders except from the enômotarch, who was in the
first instance responsible for his enômoty; but the pentekontêr and
the lochage were responsible also each for his larger division;
the pentekosty including four enômoties, and the lochus four
pentekosties, at least so the numbers stood on this occasion. All
the various military manœuvres were familiar to the Lacedæmonians
from their unremitting drill, so that their armies enjoyed the
advantage of readier obedience along with more systematic command.
Accordingly, though thus taken by surprise, and called on now for
the first time in their lives, to form in the presence of an enemy,
they only manifested the greater promptitude<a id="FNanchor_116"
href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and anxious haste in
obeying the orders of Agis, transmitted through the regular series of
officers. The battle array was attained with regularity as well as
with speed.</p>

<p>The extreme left of the Lacedæmonian line belonged by ancient
privilege to the Skiritæ; mountaineers of the border district of
Laconia, skirting the Arcadian Parrhasii, seemingly east of the
Eurotas, near its earliest and highest course. These men, originally
Arcadians, now constituted a variety of Laconian Periœki, with
peculiar duties as well as peculiar privileges. Numbered among
the bravest and most active men in Peloponnesus, they generally
formed the vanguard in an advancing march; and the Spartans stand
accused of having exposed them to danger as well as toil with
unbecoming recklessness.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117"
class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Next to the Skiritæ, who were six hundred
in number, stood the enfranchised Helots, recently returned from
serving with Brasidas in Thrace, and the Neodamôdes, both probably
summoned home from Lepreum, where we were told before that they
had been planted. After them, in the centre of the entire line,
came the Lacedæmonian lochi, seven in number, with the Arcadian
de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[p. 81]</span>pendent allies,
Heræan and Mænalian, near them. Lastly, in the right wing, stood
the Tegeans, with a small division of Lacedæmonians occupying the
extreme right, as the post of honor. On each flank there were some
Lacedæmonian horsemen.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118"
class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Thucydidês, with a frankness which enhances the value of his
testimony wherever he gives it positively, informs us that he cannot
pretend to set down the number of either army. It is evident that
this silence is not for want of having inquired; but none of the
answers which he received appeared to him trustworthy: the extreme
secrecy of Lacedæmonian politics admitted of no certainty about
<i>their</i> numbers, while the empty numerical boasts of other Greeks
were not less misleading. In the absence of assured information about
aggregate number, the historian gives us some general information
accessible to every inquirer, and some facts visible to a spectator.
From his language it is conjectured, with some probability, by Dr.
Thirlwall and others, that he was himself present at the battle,
though in what capacity we cannot determine, as he was an exile
from his country. First, he states that the Lacedæmonian army
<i>appeared</i> more numerous than that of the enemy. Next he tells us,
that independent of the Skiritæ on the left, who were six hundred
in number, the remaining Lacedæmonian front, to the extremity of
their right wing, consisted of four hundred and forty-eight men,
each enômoty having four men in front. In respect to depth, the
different enômoties were not all equal; but for the most part, the
files were eight deep. There were seven lochi in all (apart from the
Skiritæ); each lochus comprised four pentekosties, each pentekosty
contained four enômoties.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119"
class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Multiplying four hundred and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[p. 82]</span> forty-four by eight,
and adding the six hundred Skiritæ, this would make a total of four
thousand one hundred and eighty-four hoplites, besides a few horsemen
on each flank. Respecting light-armed, nothing is said. I have no
confidence in such an estimate—but the total is smaller than we
should have expected, considering that the Lacedæmonians had marched
out from Sparta with their entire force on a pressing emergency, and
that they had only sent home one-sixth of their total, their oldest
and youngest soldiers.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the generals on the Argeian side made
any attempt to charge while the Lacedæmonian battle-array was yet
incomplete. It was necessary for them, according to Grecian practice,
to wind up the courage of their troops by some words of exhortation
and encouragement: and before these were finished, the Lacedæmonians
may probably have attained their order. The Mantineian officers
reminded their countrymen that the coming battle would decide whether
Mantineia should continue to be a free and imperial city, with
Arcadian dependencies of her own, as she now was, or should again
be degraded into a dependency of Lacedæmon. The Argeian leaders
dwelt upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[p. 83]</span> the
opportunity which Argos now had of recovering her lost ascendency
in Peloponnesus, and of revenging herself upon her worst enemy and
neighbor. The Athenian troops were exhorted to show themselves worthy
of the many brave allies with whom they were now associated, as well
as to protect their own territory and empire by vanquishing their
enemy in Peloponnesus.</p>

<p>It illustrates forcibly the peculiarity of Lacedæmonian character,
that to them no similar words of encouragement were addressed either
by Agis or any of the officers. “They knew (says the historian<a
id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>)
that long practice beforehand in the business of war, was a better
preservative than fine speeches on the spur of the moment.” As among
professional soldiers, bravery was assumed as a thing of course,
without any special exhortation: but mutual suggestions were heard
among them with a view to get their order of battle and position
perfect, which at first it probably was not, from the sudden and
hurried manner in which they had been constrained to form. Moreover,
various war-songs, perhaps those of Tyrtæus, were chanted in the
ranks. At length the word was given to attack: the numerous pipers
in attendance—an hereditary caste at Sparta—began to play, while the
slow, solemn, and equable march of the troops adjusted itself to the
time given by these instruments without any break or wavering in
the line. A striking contrast to this deliberate pace was presented
by the enemy: who having no pipers or other musical instruments,
rushed forward to the charge with a step vehement and even furious,<a
id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
fresh from the exhortations just addressed to them.</p>

<p>It was the natural tendency of all Grecian armies, when
coming into conflict, to march not exactly straight forward, but
somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[p. 84]</span> aslant
towards the right. The soldiers on the extreme right of both armies
set the example of such inclination, in order to avoid exposing
their own unshielded side; while for the same reason every man along
the line took care to keep close to the shield of his right-hand
neighbor. We see from hence that, with equal numbers, the right was
not merely the post of honor, but also of comparative safety. So it
proved on the present occasion, even the Lacedæmonian discipline
being noway exempt from this cause of disturbance. Though the
Lacedæmonian front, from their superior numbers, was more extended
than that of the enemy, still their right files did not think
themselves safe without slanting still farther to the right, and
thus outflanked very greatly the Athenians on the opposite left
wing; while on the opposite side the Mantineians who formed the
right wing, from the same disposition to keep the left shoulder
forward, outflanked, though not in so great a degree, the Skiritæ and
Brasideians on the Lacedæmonian left. King Agis, whose post was with
the lochi in the centre, saw plainly that when the armies closed,
his left would be certainly taken in flank and perhaps even in the
rear. Accordingly, he thought it necessary to alter his dispositions
even at this critical moment, which he relied upon being able to
accomplish through the exact discipline, practised evolutions, and
slow march, of his soldiers.</p>

<p>The natural mode of meeting the impending danger would have been
to bring round a division from the extreme right, where it could well
be spared, to the extreme left against the advancing Mantineians. But
the ancient privilege of the Skiritæ, who always fought by themselves
on the extreme left, forbade such an order.<a id="FNanchor_122"
href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Accordingly, Agis
gave signal to the Brasideians and Skiritæ to make a flank movement
on the left so as to get on equal front with the Mantineians; while
in order to fill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[p. 85]</span>
up the vacancy thus created in his line, he sent orders to the two
polemarchs Aristoklês and Hipponoidas, who had their lochi on the
extreme right of the line, to move to the rear and take post on the
right of the Brasideians, so as again to close up the line. But these
two polemarchs, who had the safest and most victorious place in the
line, chose to keep it, disobeying his express orders: so that Agis,
when he saw that they did not move, was forced to send a second order
countermanding the flank movement of the Skiritæ, and directing them
to fall in upon the centre, back into their former place. But it
had now become too late to execute this second command before the
hostile armies closed: and the Skiritæ and Brasideians were thus
assailed while in disorder and cut off from their own centre. The
Mantineians, finding them in this condition, defeated and drove them
back; while the chosen Thousand of Argos, breaking in by the vacant
space between the Brasideians and the Lacedæmonian centre, took them
on the right flank and completed their discomfiture. They were routed
and pursued even to the Lacedæmonian baggage-wagons in the rear; some
of the elder troops who guarded the wagons being slain, and the whole
Lacedæmonian left wing altogether dispersed.</p>

<p>But the victorious Mantineians and their comrades, thinking
only of what was immediately before them, wasted thus a precious
time when their aid was urgently needed elsewhere. Matters passed
very differently on the Lacedæmonian centre and right; where Agis,
with his body-guard of three hundred chosen youths called Hippeis,
and with the Spartan lochi, found himself in front conflict with
the centre and left of the enemy;—with the Argeians, their elderly
troops and the so-called Five Lochi, with the Kleonæans and Orneates,
dependent allies of Argos, and with the Athenians. Over all these
troops they were completely victorious, after a short resistance,
indeed, on some points with no resistance at all. So formidable
was the aspect and name of the Lacedæmonians, that the opposing
troops gave way without crossing spears; and even with a panic so
headlong, that they trod down each other in anxiety to escape.<a
id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
While thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[p. 86]</span> defeated
in front, they were taken in flank by the Tegeans and Lacedæmonians
on the right of Agis’s army, and the Athenians<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_87">[p. 87]</span> here incurred serious hazard of being
all cut to pieces, had they not been effectively aided by their
own cavalry close at hand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[p.
88]</span> Moreover Agis, having decidedly beaten and driven them
back was less anxious to pursue them than to return to the rescue
of his own defeated left wing; so that even the Athenians, who
were exposed both in flank and front, were enabled to effect their
retreat in safety. The Mantineians and the Argeian Thousand, though
victorious on their part of the line, yet seeing the remainder of
their army in disorderly flight, had little disposition to renew
the combat against Agis and the conquering Lacedæmonians. They
sought only to effect their retreat, which however could not be done
without severe loss, especially on the part of the Mantineians; and
which Agis might have prevented altogether, had not the Lacedæmonian
system, enforced on this occasion by the counsels of an ancient
Spartan named Pharax, enjoyed abstinence from prolonged pursuit
against a defeated enemy.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124"
class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>There fell in this battle seven hundred men of the Argeians,
Kleonæans, and Orneates; two hundred Athenians, together with both
the generals Lachês and Nikostratus; and two hundred Mantineians.
The loss of the Lacedæmonians, though never certainly known, from
the habitual secrecy of their public proceedings, was estimated at
about three hundred men. They stripped the enemy’s dead, spreading
out to view the arms thus acquired, and selecting some for a trophy;
then picked up their own dead and carried them away for burial at
Tegea, granting the customary burial-truce to the defeated enemy.
Pleistoanax, the other Spartan king, had advanced as far as Tegea
with a reinforcement composed of the elder and younger citizens; but
on hearing of the victory, he returned back home.<a id="FNanchor_125"
href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Such was the important battle of Mantineia, fought in the month
of June 418 <small>B.C.</small> Its effect throughout
Greece was prodigious. The numbers engaged on both sides were very
considerable for a Grecian army of that day, though seemingly not
so large as at the battle of Delium five years before: the number
and grandeur of the states whose troops were engaged was, however,
greater than at Delium. But what gave peculiar value to the battle
was, that it wiped off at once the preëxisting stain upon<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[p. 89]</span> the honor of Sparta. The
disaster in Sphakteria, disappointing all previous expectation, had
drawn upon her the imputation of something like cowardice; and there
were other proceedings which, with far better reason, caused her to
be stigmatized as stupid and backward. But the victory of Mantineia
silenced all such disparaging criticism, and replaced Sparta in her
old position of military preëminence before the eyes of Greece.
It worked so much the more powerfully because it was entirely the
fruit of Lacedæmonian courage, with little aid from that peculiar
skill and tactics, which was generally seen concomitant, but had in
the present case been found comparatively wanting. The manœuvre of
Agis, in itself not ill-conceived, for the purpose of extending his
left wing, had failed through the disobedience of the two refractory
polemarchs: but in such a case the shame of failure falls more or
less upon all parties concerned; nor could either general or soldiers
be considered to have displayed at Mantineia any of that professional
aptitude which caused the Lacedæmonians to be styled “artists in
warlike affairs.” So much the more conspicuously did Lacedæmonian
courage stand out to view. After the left wing had been broken,
and when the Argeian Thousand had penetrated into the vacant space
between the left and centre, so that they might have taken the centre
in flank, and ought to have done so, had they been well advised,
the troops in the centre, instead of being daunted as most Grecian
soldiers would have been, had marched forward against the enemies
in their front, and gained a complete victory. The consequences of
the battle were thus immense in reëstablishing the reputation of the
Lacedæmonians, and in exalting them again to their ancient dignity
of chiefs of Peloponnesus.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126"
class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>We are not surprised to hear that the two polemarchs, Aristoklês
and Hipponoidas, whose disobedience had wellnigh caused the ruin
of the army, were tried and condemned to banishment as cowards, on
their return to Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127"
class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Looking at the battle from the point of view of the other
side,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[p. 90]</span> we may
remark, that the defeat was greatly occasioned by the selfish
caprice of the Eleians in withdrawing their three thousand men
immediately before the battle, because the other allies, instead
of marching against Lepreum, preferred to attempt the far more
important town of Tegea: an additional illustration of the remark
of Periklês at the beginning of the war, that numerous and
equal allies could never be kept in harmonious coöperation.<a
id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
Shortly after the defeat, the three thousand Eleians came back
to the aid of Mantineia,—probably regretting their previous
untoward departure,—together with a reinforcement of one thousand
Athenians. Moreover, the Karneian month began, a season which the
Lacedæmonians kept rigidly holy; even despatching messengers to
countermand their extra-Peloponnesian allies, whom they had invoked
prior to the late battle,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129"
class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and remaining themselves within their
own territory, so that the field was for the moment left clear for
the operations of a defeated enemy. Accordingly, the Epidaurians,
though they had made an inroad into the territory of Argos during the
absence of the Argeian main force at the time of the late battle, and
had gained a partial success, now found their own territory overrun
by the united Eleians, Mantineians, and Athenians, who were bold
enough even to commence a wall of circumvallation round the town of
Epidaurus itself. The entire work was distributed between them to
be accomplished; but the superior activity and perseverance of the
Athenians was here displayed in a conspicuous manner. For while the
portion of work committed to them—the fortification of the cape on
which the Heræum or temple of Hêrê was situated—was indefatigably
prosecuted and speedily brought to completion, their allies, both
Eleians and Mantineians, abandoned the tasks respectively allotted
to them in impatience and disgust. The idea of circumvallation
being for this reason relinquished, a joint garrison was left in
the new fort at Cape Heræum, after which the allies evacuated the
Epidaurian territory.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130"
class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>So far, the Lacedæmonians appeared to have derived little
positive benefit from their late victory: but the fruits of it
were soon manifested in the very centre of their enemy’s force, at
Argos. A material change had taken place since the battle in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[p. 91]</span> the political tendencies
of that city. There had been within it always an opposition party,
philo-Laconian and anti-democratical: and the effect of the defeat of
Mantineia had been to strengthen this party as much as it depressed
their opponents. The democratical leaders, who, in conjunction with
Athens and Alkibiades, had aspired to maintain an ascendency in
Peloponnesus hostile and equal, if not superior to Sparta, now found
their calculations overthrown and exchanged for the discouraging
necessities of self-defence against a victorious enemy. And while
these leaders thus lost general influence by so complete a defeat
of their foreign policy, the ordinary democratical soldiers of
Argos brought back with them from the field of Mantineia, nothing
but humiliation and terror of the Lacedæmonian arms. But the chosen
Argeian Thousand-regiment returned with very different feelings.
Victorious over the left wing of their enemies, they had not been
seriously obstructed in their retreat even by the Lacedæmonian
centre. They had thus reaped positive glory,<a id="FNanchor_131"
href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and doubtless felt
contempt for their beaten fellow-citizens. Now it has been already
mentioned that these Thousand were men of rich families, and the best
military age, set apart by the Argeian democracy to receive permanent
training at the public expense, just at a time when the ambitious
views of Argos first began to dawn, after the Peace of Nikias. So
long as Argos was likely to become or continue the imperial state of
Peloponnesus, these Thousand wealthy men would probably find their
dignity sufficiently consulted in upholding her as such, and would
thus acquiesce in the democratical government. But when the defeat
of Mantineia reduced Argos to her own limits, and threw her upon
the defensive, there was nothing to counterbalance their natural
oligarchical sentiments, so that they became decided opponents of
the democratical government in its distress. The oligarchical<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[p. 92]</span> party in Argos, thus
encouraged and reinforced, entered into a conspiracy with the
Lacedæmonians to bring the city into alliance with Sparta as well as
to overthrow the democracy.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132"
class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>As the first step towards the execution of this scheme, the
Lacedæmonians, about the end of September, marched out their
full forces as far as Tegea, thus threatening invasion, and
inspiring terror at Argos. From Tegea they sent forward as envoy
Lichas, proxenus of the Argeians at Sparta, with two alternative
propositions: one for peace, which he was instructed to tender and
prevail upon the Argeians to accept, if he could; another, in case
they refused, of a menacing character. It was the scheme of the
oligarchical faction first to bring the city into alliance with
Lacedæmon and dissolve the connection with Athens, before they
attempted any innovation in the government. The arrival of Lichas
was the signal for them to manifest themselves by strenuously
pressing the acceptance of his pacific proposition. But they had
to contend against a strong resistance; since Alkibiadês, still in
Argos, employed his utmost energy to defeat their views. Nothing
but the presence of the Lacedæmonian army at Tegea, and the general
despondency of the people, at length enabled them to carry their
point, and to procure acceptance of the proposed treaty; which being
already adopted by the ekklesia at Sparta, was sent ready prepared to
Argos, and there sanctioned without alteration. The conditions were
substantially as follows:—</p>

<p>“The Argeians shall restore the boys whom they have received as
hostages from Orchomenus, and the men-hostages from the Mænalii.
They shall restore to the Lacedæmonians the men now in Mantineia,
whom the Lacedæmonians had placed as hostages for safe custody in
Orchomenus, and whom the Argeians and Mantineians have carried away
from that place. They shall evacuate Epidaurus, and raze the fort
recently erected near it. The Athenians, unless they also forthwith
evacuate Epidaurus, shall be proclaimed as enemies to Lacedæmon as
well as to Argos, and to the allies of both. The Lacedæmonians shall
restore all the hostages whom they now have in keeping, from whatever
place they may have been taken. Respecting the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_93">[p. 93]</span> sacrifice alleged to be due to Apollo by
the Epidaurians, the Argeians will consent to tender to them an oath,
which if they swear, they shall clear themselves.<a id="FNanchor_133"
href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Every city in
Peloponnesus, small or great, shall be autonomous and at liberty to
maintain its own ancient constitution. If any extra-Peloponnesian
city shall come against Peloponnesus with mischievous projects,
Lacedæmon and Argos will take joint counsel against it, in the manner
most equitable for the interest of the Peloponnesians generally.
The extra-Peloponnesian allies of Sparta shall be in the same
position with reference to this treaty as the allies of Lacedæmon
and Argos in Peloponnesus, and shall hold their own in the same
manner. The Argeians shall show this treaty to their allies, who
shall be admitted to subscribe to it, if they think fit. But if the
allies desire anything different, the Argeians shall send them home
about their business.”<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134"
class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[p. 94]</span></p>

<p>Such was the agreement sent ready prepared by the Lacedæmonians
to Argos, and there literally accepted. It presented a reciprocity
little more than nominal, imposing one obligation of no importance
upon Sparta; though it answered the purpose of the latter by
substantially dissolving the alliance of Argos with its three
confederates.</p>

<p>But this treaty was meant by the oligarchical party in Argos
only as preface to a series of ulterior measures. As soon as it was
concluded, the menacing army of Sparta was withdrawn from Tegea, and
was exchanged for free and peaceful intercommunication between the
Lacedæmonians and Argeians. Probably Alkibiadês at the same time
retired, while the renewed visits and hospitalities of Lacedæmonians
at Argos strengthened the interest of their party more than ever.
They were soon powerful enough to persuade the Argeian assembly
formally to renounce the alliance with Athens, Elis, and Mantineia,
and to conclude a special alliance with Sparta, on the following
terms:—</p>

<p>“There shall be peace and alliance for fifty years between the
Lacedæmonians and the Argeians—upon equal terms—each giving amicable
satisfaction, according to its established constitution, to all
complaints preferred by the other. On the same condition, also, the
other Peloponnesian cities shall partake in this peace and alliance,
holding their own territory, laws, and separate constitution. All
extra-Peloponnesian allies of Sparta shall be put upon the same
footing as the Lacedæmonians themselves. The allies of Argos shall
also be put upon the same footing as Argos herself, holding their
own territory undisturbed. Should occasion arise for common military
operations on any point, the Lacedæmonians and Argeians shall take
counsel together, determining in the most equitable manner they can
for the interest of their allies. If any one of the cities hereunto
belonging, either in or out of Peloponnesus, shall have disputes
either about boundaries or other topics, she shall be held bound
to enter upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[p. 95]</span>
amicable adjustment.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135"
class="fnanchor">[135]</a> If any allied city shall quarrel with
another allied city, the matter shall be referred to some third city
satisfactory to both. Each city shall render justice to her own
citizens according to her own ancient constitution.”</p>

<p>It will be observed that in this treaty of alliance, the disputed
question of headship is compromised or evaded. Lacedæmon and Argos
are both put upon an equal footing, in respect to taking joint
counsel for the general body of allies: they two alone are to decide,
without consulting the other allies, though binding themselves to
have regard to the interests of the latter. The policy of Lacedæmon
also pervades the treaty, that of insuring autonomy to all the lesser
states of Peloponnesus, and thus breaking up the empire of Elis,
Mantineia, or any other larger state which might have dependencies.<a
id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
And accordingly the Mantineians, finding themselves abandoned
by Argos, were constrained to make their submission to Sparta,
enrolling themselves again as her allies, renouncing all command over
their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[p. 96]</span> Arcadian
subjects, and delivering up the hostages of these latter, according
to the stipulation in the treaty between Lacedæmon and Argos.<a
id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The
Lacedæmonians do not seem to have meddled farther with Elis. Being
already possessed of Lepreum,—through the Brasideian settlers planted
there,—they perhaps did not wish again to provoke the Eleians, from
fear of being excluded a second time from the Olympic festival.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the conclusion of the alliance with Lacedæmon—about
November or December, 418 <small>B.C.</small>—had still
farther depressed the popular leaders at Argos. The oligarchical
faction, and the chosen regiment of the Thousand, all men of wealth
and family, as well as bound together by their common military
training, now saw their way clearly to the dissolution of the
democracy by force, and to the accomplishment of a revolution.
Instigated by such ambitious views, and flattered by the idea
of admitted headship jointly with Sparta, they espoused the new
policy of the city with extreme vehemence, and began immediately
to multiply occasions of collision with Athens. Joint Lacedæmonian
and Argeian envoys were despatched to Thrace and Macedonia. With
the Chalkidians of Thrace, the revolted subjects of Athens, the
old alliance was renewed and even new engagements concluded; while
Perdikkas of Macedonia was urged to renounce his covenants with
Athens, and join the new confederacy. In that quarter the influence
of Argos was considerable; for the Macedonian princes prized very
highly their ancient descent from Argos, which constituted them
brethren of the Hellenic family. Accordingly, Perdikkas consented
to the demand and concluded the new treaty; insisting, however,
with his habitual duplicity, that the step should for the moment be
kept secret from Athens.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138"
class="fnanchor">[138]</a> In farther pursuance of the new tone
of hostility to that city, joint envoys were also sent thither,
to require that the Athenians should quit Peloponnesus, and
especially that they should evacuate the fort recently erected
near Epidaurus. It seems to have been held jointly by Argeians,
Mantineians, Eleians, and Athenians; and as the latter were only
a minority of the whole, the Athenians in the city judged<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[p. 97]</span> it prudent to send
Dêmosthenês to bring them away. That general not only effected
the retreat, but also contrived a stratagem, which gave to it the
air almost of an advantage. On his first arrival in the fort, he
proclaimed a gymnastic match outside of the gates for the amusement
of the whole garrison, contriving to keep back the Athenians
within until all the rest had marched out: then hastily shutting
the gates, he remained master of the place.<a id="FNanchor_139"
href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Having no intention,
however, of keeping it, he made it over presently to the Epidaurians
themselves, with whom he renewed the truce to which they had been
parties jointly with the Lacedæmonians five years before, two years
before the Peace of Nikias.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140"
class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>The mode of proceeding here resorted to by Athens, in respect to
the surrender of the fort, seems to have been dictated by a desire
to manifest her displeasure against the Argeians. This was exactly
what the Argeian leaders and oligarchical party, on their side, most
desired; the breach with Athens had become irreparable, and their
plans were now matured for violently subverting their own democracy.
They concerted with Sparta a joint military expedition, of one
thousand hoplites from each city,—the first joint expedition under
the new alliance,—against Sikyôn, for the purpose of introducing more
thorough-paced oligarchy into the already oligarchical Sikyônian
government. It is possible that there may have been some democratical
opposition gradually acquiring strength at Sikyôn: but that city
seems to have been, as far as we know, always oligarchical in policy,
and passively faithful to Sparta. Probably, therefore, the joint
enterprise against Sikyôn was nothing more than a pretext to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[p. 98]</span> cover the introduction
of one thousand Lacedæmonian hoplites into Argos, whither the joint
detachment immediately returned, after the business at Sikyôn had
been accomplished. Thus reinforced, the oligarchical leaders and
the chosen Thousand at Argos put down by force the democratical
constitution in that city, slew the democratical leaders, and
established themselves in complete possession of the government.<a
id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>This revolution, accomplished about February, <small>B.C.</small>
417, the result of the victory of Mantineia and the consummation
of a train of policy laid by Sparta, raised her ascendency in
Peloponnesus to a higher and more undisputed point than it had ever
before attained. The towns in Achaia were as yet not sufficiently
oligarchical for her purpose, perhaps since the march of Alkibiadês
thither, two years before; accordingly, she now remodelled their
governments in conformity with her own views. The new rulers of Argos
were subservient to her, not merely from oligarchical sympathy, but
from need of her aid to keep down internal rising against themselves:
so that there was neither enemy, nor even neutral, to counter-work
her or to favor Athens, throughout the whole peninsula.</p>

<p>But the Spartan ascendency at Argos was not destined to last.
Though there were many cities in Greece, in which oligarchies long
maintained themselves unshaken, through adherence to a traditional
routine and by being usually in the hands of men accustomed to
govern, yet an oligarchy erected by force upon the ruins of a
democracy was rarely of long duration. The angry discontent of
the people, put down by temporary intimidation, usually revived,
and threatened the security of the rulers enough to render them
suspicious and probably cruel. Nor was such cruelty their only fault:
they found their emancipation from democratical restraints too
tempting to be able to control either their lust or their rapacity.
With the population of Argos, comparatively coarse and brutal in
all ranks, and more like Korkyra than like<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_99">[p. 99]</span> Athens, such abuse was pretty sure to
be speedy as well as flagrant. Especially the chosen regiment of
the Thousand—men in the vigor of their age, and proud of their
military prowess as well as of their wealthier station—construed
the new oligarchical government which they had helped to erect as
a period of individual license to themselves. The behavior and
fate of their chief, Bryas, illustrates the general demeanor of
the troop. After many other outrages against persons of poorer
condition, he one day met in the streets a wedding procession, in
which the person of the bride captivated his fancy. He caused her
to be violently torn from her company, carried her to his house,
and possessed himself of her by force. But in the middle of the
night, this high-spirited woman revenged herself for the outrage by
putting out the eyes of the ravisher while he was fast asleep:<a
id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> a
terrible revenge, which the pointed clasp-pins of the feminine attire
sometimes enabled women<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143"
class="fnanchor">[143]</a> to take upon those who wronged them.
Having contrived to make her escape, she found concealment among her
friends, as well as protection among the people generally against the
indignant efforts of the chosen Thousand to avenge their leader.</p>

<p>From incidents such as this, and from the multitude of petty
insults which so flagitious an outrage implies as coexistent, we
are not surprised to learn that the Demos of Argos soon recovered
their lost courage, and resolved upon an effort to put down their
oligarchical oppressors. They waited for the moment when the
festival called the Gymnopædiæ was in course of being solemnized
at Sparta,—a festival at which the choric performances of men and
boys were so interwoven with Spartan religion as well as bodily
training, that the Lacedæmonians would make no military movement
until they were finished. At this critical moment, the Argeian Demos
rose in insurrection, and after a sharp contest gained a victory
over the oligarchy, some of whom were slain, while others only saved
themselves by flight. Even at the first instant of danger, pressing
messages had been sent to Sparta for aid. But the Lacedæmonians
at first peremptorily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[p.
100]</span> refused to move during the period of their festival:
nor was it until messenger after messenger had arrived to set forth
the pressing necessity of their friends, that they reluctantly put
aside their festival to march towards Argos. They were too late:
the precious moment had already passed by. They were met at Tegea
by an intimation that their friends were overthrown, and Argos in
possession of the victorious people. Nevertheless, various exiles who
had escaped still promised them success, urgently entreating them
to proceed, but the Lacedæmonians refused to comply, returned to
Sparta, and resumed their intermitted festival.<a id="FNanchor_144"
href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Thus was the oligarchy of Argos overthrown, after a
continuance of about four months,<a id="FNanchor_145"
href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> from February to
June, 417 <small>B.C.</small>, and the chosen Thousand-regiment
either dissolved or destroyed. The movement excited great
sympathy in several Peloponnesian cities,<a id="FNanchor_146"
href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> who were becoming
jealous of the exorbitant preponderance of Sparta. Nevertheless,
the Argeian Demos, though victorious within the city, felt so much
distrust of being able to maintain themselves, that they sent envoys
to Sparta to plead their cause and to entreat favorable treatment: a
proceeding which proves the insurrection to have been spontaneous,
not fomented by Athens. But the envoys of the expelled oligarchs were
there to confront them, and the Lacedæmonians, after a lengthened
discussion, adjudging the Demos to have been guilty of wrong,
proclaimed the resolution of sending forces to put them down. Still,
the habitual tardiness of Lacedæmonian habits prevented any immediate
or separate movement. Their allies were to be summoned, none being
very zealous in the cause, and least of all at this moment, when the
period of harvest was at hand; so that about three months intervened
before any actual force was brought together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[p. 101]</span></p>

<p>This important interval was turned to account by the Argeian
Demos, who, being plainly warned that they were to look on Sparta
only as an enemy, immediately renewed their alliance with Athens.
Regarding her as their main refuge, they commenced the building
of long walls to connect their city with the sea, in order that
the road might always be open for supplies and reinforcement
from Athens, in case they should be confined to their walls by a
superior Spartan force. The whole Argeian population—men and women,
free and slave—set about the work with the utmost ardor: while
Alkibiadês brought assistance from Athens,<a id="FNanchor_147"
href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> especially skilled
masons and carpenters, of whom they stood in much need. The step may
probably have been suggested by himself, as it was the same which,
two years before, he had urged upon the inhabitants of Patræ. But
the construction of walls adequate for defence, along the line of
four miles and a half between Argos and the sea,<a id="FNanchor_148"
href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> required a long time.
Moreover, the oligarchical party within the town, as well as the
exiles without,—a party defeated but not annihilated,—strenuously
urged the Lacedæmonians to put an end to the work, and even promised
them a counter-revolutionary movement in the town as soon as they
drew near to assist; the same intrigue which had been entered into
by the oligarchical party at Athens forty years before, when the
walls down to Peiræus were in course of erection.<a id="FNanchor_149"
href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Accordingly about
the end of September, 417 <small>B.C.</small>, king
Agis conducted an army of Lacedæmonians and allies against Argos,
drove the population within the city, and destroyed so much of the
long walls as had been already raised. But the oligarchical party
within were not able to realize their engagements of rising in
arms, so that he was obliged to retire after merely ravaging the
territory and taking the town of Hysiæ, where he put to death all the
freemen who fell into his hands. After his departure, the Argeians
retaliated these ravages upon the neighboring territory of Phlius,
where the exiles from Argos chiefly resided.<a id="FNanchor_150"
href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[p. 102]</span></p>

<p>The close neighborhood of such exiles, together with the declared
countenance of Sparta, and the continued schemes of the oligarchical
party within the walls, kept the Argeian democracy in perpetual
uneasiness and alarm throughout the winter, in spite of their
recent victory and the suppression of the dangerous regiment of a
Thousand. To relieve them in part from embarrassment, Alkibiadês
was despatched thither early in the spring with an Athenian
armament and twenty triremes. His friends and guests appear to
have been now in the ascendency, as leaders of the democratical
government; and in concert with them, he selected three hundred
marked oligarchical persons, whom he carried away and deposited in
various Athenian islands, as hostages for the quiescence of the
party, <small>B.C.</small> 416. Another ravaging march
was also undertaken by the Argeians into the territory of Phlius,
wherein, however, they sustained nothing but loss. And again, about
the end of September, the Lacedæmonians gave the word for a second
expedition against Argos. But having marched as far as the borders,
they found the sacrifices—always offered previous to leaving their
own territory—so unfavorable, that they returned back and disbanded
their forces. The Argeian oligarchical party, in spite of the
hostages recently taken from them, had been on the watch for this
Lacedæmonian force, and had projected a rising; or at least were
suspected of doing so, to such a degree that some of them were seized
and imprisoned by the government, while others made their escape.<a
id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
Later in the same winter, however, the Lacedæmonians became more
fortunate with their border sacrifices, entered the Argeian territory
in conjunction with their allies (except the Corinthians, who
refused to take part), and established the Argeian oligarchi<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[p. 103]</span>cal exiles at Orneæ:
from which town these latter were again speedily expelled, after
the retirement of the Lacedæmonian army, by the Argeian democracy
with the aid of an Athenian reinforcement.<a id="FNanchor_152"
href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>To maintain the renewed democratical government of Argos, against
enemies both internal and external, was an important policy to
Athens, as affording the basis, which might afterwards be extended,
of an anti-Laconian party in Peloponnesus. But at the present time
the Argeian alliance was a drain and an exhaustion rather than a
source of strength to Athens: very different from the splendid hopes
which it had presented prior to the battle of Mantineia, hopes of
supplanting Sparta in her ascendency within the Isthmus. It is
remarkable, that in spite of the complete alienation of feeling
between Athens and Sparta,—and continued reciprocal hostilities,
in an indirect manner, so long as each was acting as ally of some
third party,—nevertheless, neither the one nor the other would
formally renounce the sworn alliance, nor obliterate the record
inscribed on its stone column. Both parties shrank from proclaiming
the real truth, though each half year brought them a step nearer
to it in fact. Thus during the course of the present summer (416
<small>B.C.</small>) the Athenian and Messenian garrison at Pylos
became more active than ever in their incursions on Laconia, and
brought home large booty; upon which the Lacedæmonians, though
still not renouncing the alliance, publicly proclaimed their
willingness to grant what we may call letters of marque, to any
one, for privateering against Athenian commerce. The Corinthians
also, on private grounds of quarrel, commenced hostilities
against the Athenians.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153"
class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Yet still Sparta and her allies remained
in a state of formal peace with Athens: the Athenians resisted
all the repeated solicitations of the Argeians to induce them to
make a landing on any part of Laconia and commit devastation.<a
id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
Nor was the license of free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[p.
104]</span> intercourse for individuals as yet suspended. We cannot
doubt that the Athenians were invited to the Olympic festival of
416 <small>B.C.</small> (the 91st Olympiad), and sent thither
their solemn legation along with those of Sparta and other Dorian
Greeks.</p>

<p>Now that they had again become allies of Argos, the Athenians
probably found out, more fully than they had before known, the
intrigue carried on by the former Argeian government with the
Macedonian Perdikkas. The effects of these intrigues, however, had
made themselves felt even earlier in the conduct of that prince, who,
having as an ally of Athens engaged to coöperate with an Athenian
expedition projected under Nikias for the spring or summer of 417
<small>B.C.</small> against the Chalkidians of Thrace
and Amphipolis, now withdrew his concurrence, receded from the
alliance of Athens, and frustrated the whole scheme of expedition.
The Athenians accordingly placed the ports of Macedonia under naval
blockade, proclaiming Perdikkas an enemy.<a id="FNanchor_155"
href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Nearly five years had elapsed since the defeat of Kleon, without
any fresh attempt to recover Amphipolis: the project just alluded
to appears to have been the first. The proceedings of the Athenians
with regard to this important town afford ample proof of that want
of wisdom on the part of their leading men Nikias and Alkibiades,
and of erroneous tendencies on the part of the body of the citizens,
which we shall gradually find conducting their empire to ruin. Among
all their possessions out of Attica, there was none so valuable as
Amphipolis: the centre of a great commercial and mining region,
situated on a large river and lake which the Athenian navy could
readily command, and claimed by them with reasonable justice, since
it was their original colony, planted by their wisest statesman,
Periklês. It had been lost only through unpardonable negligence on
the part of their generals; and when lost, we should have expected
to see the chief energies of Athens directed to the recovery of it;
the more so, as, if once recovered, it admitted of being made sure
and retained as a future possession. Kleon is the only leading man
who at once proclaims to his countrymen the important truth that
it never can be recovered except by force. He strenuously<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[p. 105]</span> urges his countrymen
to make the requisite military effort, and prevails upon them in
part to do so, but the attempt disgracefully fails; partly through
his own incompetence as commander, whether his undertaking of that
duty was a matter of choice or of constraint, partly through the
strong opposition and antipathy against him from so large a portion
of his fellow-citizens, which rendered the military force not hearty
in the enterprise. Next, Nikias, Lachês, and Alkibiadês, all concur
in making peace and alliance with the Lacedæmonians, with express
promise and purpose to procure the restoration of Amphipolis. But
after a series of diplomatic proceedings, which display as much
silly credulity in Nikias as selfish deceit in Alkibiadês, the
result becomes evident, as Kleon had insisted, that peace will
not restore to them Amphipolis, and that it can only be regained
by force. The fatal defect of Nikias is now conspicuously seen:
his inertness of character and incapacity of decided or energetic
effort. When he discovered that he had been out-manœuvred by the
Lacedæmonian diplomacy, and had fatally misadvised his countrymen
into making important cessions on the faith of equivalents to
come, we might have expected to find him spurred on by indignant
repentance for this mistake, and putting forth his own strongest
efforts, as well as those of his country, in order to recover
those portions of her empire which the peace had promised, but did
not restore. Instead of which he exhibits no effective movement,
while Alkibiadês begins to display the defects of his political
character, yet more dangerous than those of Nikias, the passion
for showy, precarious, boundless, and even perilous novelties. It
is only in the year 417 <small>B.C.</small>, after the
defeat of Mantineia had put an end to the political speculations of
Alkibiadês in the interior of Peloponnesus, that Nikias projects an
expedition against Amphipolis; and even then it is projected only
contingent upon the aid of Perdikkas, a prince of notorious perfidy.
It was not by any half-exertions of force that the place could be
regained, as the defeat of Kleon had sufficiently proved. We obtain
from these proceedings a fair measure of the foreign politics of
Athens at this time, during what is called the Peace of Nikias,
preparing us for that melancholy catastrophe which will be developed
in the coming chapters, where she is brought<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_106">[p. 106]</span> near to ruin by the defects of Nikias
and Alkibiadês combined for, by singular misfortune, she does not
reap the benefit of the good qualities of either.</p>

<p>It was in one of the three years between 420-416
<small>B.C.</small>, though we do not know in which, that the vote
of ostracism took place, arising out of the contention between
Nikias and Alkibiadês.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156"
class="fnanchor">[156]</a> The political antipathy between the two
having reached a point of great violence, it was proposed that a vote
of ostracism should be taken, and this proposition—probably made by
the partisans of Nikias, since Alkibiadês was the person most likely
to be reputed dangerous—was adopted by the people. Hyperbolus the
lamp-maker, son of Cheremês, a speaker of considerable influence in
the public assembly, strenuously supported it, hating Nikias not
less than Alkibiadês. Hyperbolus is named by Aristophanês as having
succeeded Kleon in the mastership of the rostrum in the Pnyx:<a
id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> if
this were true, his supposed demagogic preëminence would commence
about September 422 <small>B.C.</small>, the period of the death of
Kleon. Long before that time, however, he had been among the chief
butts of the comic authors, who ascribe to him the same baseness,
dishonesty, impudence, and malignity in accusation, as that which
they fasten upon Kleon, though in language which seems to imply an
inferior idea of his power. And it may be doubted whether Hyperbolus
ever succeeded to the same influence as had been enjoyed by Kleon,
when we observe that Thucydidês does not name him in any of the
important debates which took place at and after the Peace of Nikias.
Thucydidês only mentions him once, in 411 <small>B.C.</small>,
while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[p. 107]</span> he was in
banishment under sentence of ostracism, and resident at Samos. He
terms him, “one Hyperbolus, a low busy-body, who had been ostracized,
not from fear of dangerous excess of dignity and power, but through
his wickedness and his being felt as a disgrace to the city.”<a
id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
This sentence of Thucydidês is really the only evidence against
Hyperbolus: for it is not less unjust in his case than in that of
Kleon to cite the jests and libels of comedy as if they were so
much authentic fact and trustworthy criticism. It was at Samos that
Hyperbolus was slain by the oligarchical conspirators who were aiming
to overthrow the democracy at Athens. We have no particular facts
respecting him to enable us to test the general character given by
Thucydidês.</p>

<p>At the time when the resolution was adopted at Athens, to take
a vote of ostracism suggested by the political dissension between
Nikias and Alkibiadês, about twenty-four years had elapsed since a
similar vote had been resorted to; the last example having been that
of Periklês and Thucydidês son of Melêsius, the latter of whom was
ostracized about 442 <small>B.C.</small> The democratical
constitution had become sufficiently confirmed to lessen materially
the necessity for ostracism as a safeguard against individual
usurpers: moreover, there was now full confidence in the numerous
dikasteries as competent to deal with the greatest of such criminals,
thus abating the necessity as conceived in men’s minds, not less
than the real necessity, for such precautionary intervention. Under
such a state of things, altered reality as well as altered feeling,
we are not surprised to find that the vote of ostracism now invoked,
though we do not know the circumstances which immediately preceded
it, ended in an abuse, or rather in a sort of parody, of the ancient
preventive. At a moment of extreme heat of party dispute, the
friends of Alkibiadês probably accepted the challenge of Nikias and
concurred in supporting a vote of ostracism; each hoping to get
rid of the opponent. The vote was accordingly decreed, but before
it actually took place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[p.
108]</span> the partisans of both changed their views, and preferred
to let the political dissension proceed without closing it by
separating the combatants. But the ostracizing vote, having been
formally pronounced, could not now be prevented from taking place:
it was always, however, perfectly general in its form, admitting of
any citizen being selected for temporary banishment. Accordingly,
the two opposing parties, each doubtless including various clubs,
or hetæries, and according to some accounts the friends of Phæax
also, united to turn the vote against some one else: and they
fixed upon a man whom all of them jointly disliked, Hyperbolus.<a
id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
By thus concurring, they obtained a sufficient number of votes
against him to pass the sentence, and he was sent into temporary
banishment. But such a result was in no one’s contemplation when the
vote was decreed to take place, and Plutarch even represents the
people as clapping their hands at it as a good joke. It was presently
recognized by every one, seemingly even by the enemies of Hyperbolus,
as a gross abuse of the ostracism. And the language of Thucydidês
himself distinctly implies this; for if we even grant that Hyperbolus
fully deserved the censure which that historian bestows, no one could
treat his presence as dangerous to the commonwealth; nor was the
ostracism introduced to meet low dishonesty or wickedness. It was,
even before, passing out of the political morality of Athens; and
this sentence consummated its extinction, so that we never hear of
it as employed afterwards. It had been extremely valuable in earlier
days, as a security to the growing democracy against individual
usurpation of power, and against dangerous exaggeration of rivalry
between individual leaders: but the democracy was now strong enough
to dispense with such exceptional protection. Yet if Alkibiadês
had returned as victor from Syracuse, it is highly probable that
the Athenians would have had no other means than the precautionary
antidote of ostracism to save themselves from him as despot.</p>

<p>It was in the beginning of summer (416 <small>B.C.</small>) that
the Athenians undertook the siege and conquest of the Dorian island
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[p. 109]</span> Mêlos, one
of the Cyclades, and the only one, except Thêra, which was not
already included in their empire. Mêlos and Thêra were both ancient
colonies of Lacedæmon, with whom they had strong sympathies of
lineage. They had never joined the confederacy of Delos, nor been
in any way connected with Athens; but at the same time, neither had
they ever taken part in the recent war against her, nor given her
any ground of complaint,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160"
class="fnanchor">[160]</a> until she landed and attacked them in the
sixth year of the recent war. She now renewed her attempt, sending
against the island a considerable force under Kleomêdês and Tisias:
thirty Athenian triremes, with six Chian and two Lesbian, twelve
hundred Athenian hoplites, and fifteen hundred hoplites from the
allies, with three hundred bowmen and twenty horse-bowmen. These
officers, after disembarking their forces, and taking position, sent
envoys into the city summoning the government to surrender, and to
become a subject-ally of Athens.</p>

<p>It was a practice, frequent, if not universal, in Greece, even in
governments not professedly democratical—to discuss propositions for
peace or war before the assembly of the people. But on the present
occasion the Melian leaders departed from this practice, and admitted
the envoys only to a private conversation with their executive
council. Of this conversation Thucydidês professes to give a detailed
and elaborate account, at surprising length, considering his general
brevity. He sets down thirteen distinct observations, with as many
replies, interchanged between the Athenian envoys and the Melians; no
one of them separately long, and some very short; but the dialogue
carried on is dramatic, and very impressive. There is, indeed, every
reason for concluding that what we here read in Thucydidês is in
far larger proportion his own and in smaller proportion authentic
report, than any of the other speeches which he professes to set
down. For this was not a public harangue, in respect to which he
might have had the opportunity of consulting the recollection of
many different persons: it was a private conversation, wherein three
or four Athenians, and perhaps ten or a dozen Melians, may have
taken part. Now as all the Melian population were slain imme<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[p. 110]</span>diately after the
capture of the town, there remained only the Athenian envoys through
whose report Thucydidês could possibly have heard what really passed.
That he did hear either from or through them the general character of
what passed, I make no doubt: but there is no ground for believing
that he received from them anything like the consecutive stream of
debate, which, together with part of the illustrative reasoning, we
must refer to his dramatic genius and arrangement.</p>

<p>The Athenian begins by restricting the subject of discussion to
the mutual interests of both parties in the peculiar circumstances
in which they now stand, in spite of the disposition of the Melians
to enlarge the range of topics, by introducing considerations of
justice and appealing to the sentiment of impartial critics. He will
not multiply words to demonstrate the just origin of the Athenian
empire, erected on the expulsion of the Persians, or to set forth
injury suffered, as pretext for the present expedition. Nor will he
listen to any plea on the part of the Melians, that they, though
colonists of Sparta, have never fought alongside of her or done
Athens wrong. He presses upon them to aim at what is attainable under
existing circumstances, since they know as well as he that justice
in the reasoning of mankind is settled according to equal compulsion
on both sides; the strong doing what their power allows, and the
weak submitting to it.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161"
class="fnanchor">[161]</a> To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[p.
111]</span> this the Melians reply, that—omitting all appeal to
justice, and speaking only of what was expedient—they hold it to
be even expedient for Athens not to break down the common moral
sanction of mankind, but to permit that equity and justice shall
still remain as a refuge for men in trouble, with some indulgence
even towards those who may be unable to make out a case of full and
strict right. Most of all was this the interest of Athens herself,
inasmuch as her ruin, if it ever occurred, would be awful both as
punishment to herself and as lesson to others.—“We are not afraid
of <i>that</i> (rejoined the Athenian) even if our empire should be
overthrown. It is not imperial cities like Sparta who deal harshly
with the conquered. Moreover, our present contest is not undertaken
against Sparta; it is a contest to determine whether subjects shall
by their own attack prevail over their rulers. This is a risk for us
to judge of: in the mean time, let us remind you that we come here
for the advantage of our own empire, and that we are now speaking
with a view to your safety; wishing to get you under our empire
without trouble to ourselves, and to preserve you for the mutual
benefit of both of us.”—“Cannot you leave us alone, and let us be
your friends instead of enemies, but neither allies of you nor of
Sparta?” said the Melians.—“No (is the reply); your friendship does
us more harm than your enmity: your friendship is a proof of our
weakness, in the eyes of our subject-allies; your enmity will give
a demonstration of our power.”—“But do your subjects really take
such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[p. 112]</span> a measure
of equity, as to put us, who have no sort of connection with you,
on the same footing with themselves, most of whom are your own
colonists, while many of them have even revolted from you and been
reconquered?”—“They do: for they think that both one and the other
have fair ground for claiming independence, and that if you are left
independent, this arises only from your power and from our fear
to attack you. So that your submission will not only enlarge our
empire, but strengthen our security throughout the whole; especially
as you are islanders, and feeble islanders too, while we are lords
of the sea.”—“But surely that very circumstance is in other ways a
protection to you, as evincing your moderation: for if you attack
us, you will at once alarm all neutrals, and convert them into
enemies.”—“We are in little fear of continental cities, who are out
of our reach and not likely to take part against us, but only of
islanders; either yet unincorporated in our empire, like you, or
already in our empire and discontented with the constraint which
it imposes. It is such islanders who by their ill-judged obstinacy
are likely, with their eyes open, to bring both us and themselves
into peril.”—“We know well (said the Melians, after some other
observations had been interchanged) how terrible it is to contend
against your superior power, and your good fortune; nevertheless, we
trust that in point of fortune we shall receive fair treatment from
the gods, since we stand upon grounds of right against injustice;
and as to our inferior power, we trust that the deficiency will be
made up by our ally Sparta, whose kindred race will compel her from
very shame to aid us.”—“We too (replied the Athenians) think that we
shall not be worse off than others in regard to the divine favor. For
we neither advance any claim, nor do any act, overpassing that which
men believe in regard to the gods, and wish in regard to themselves.
What we believe about the gods is the same as that which we see
to be the practice of men: the impulse of nature inclines them of
necessity to rule over what is inferior in force to themselves. This
is the principle on which we now proceed,—not having been the first
either to lay it down or to follow it, but finding it established and
likely to continue for ever,—and knowing well too that you or others
in our position would do as much. As for your expectations from the
Lacedæmonians, founded on the disgrace of their<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_113">[p. 113]</span> remaining deaf to your call, we
congratulate you indeed on your innocent simplicity, but we at the
same time deprecate such foolishness. For the Lacedæmonians are
indeed most studious of excellence in regard to themselves and their
own national customs. But looking at their behavior towards others,
we affirm roundly, and can prove by many examples of their history,
that they are of all men the most conspicuous in construing what is
pleasing as if it were honorable, and what is expedient as if it were
just. Now that is not the state of mind which you require, to square
with your desperate calculations of safety.”</p>

<p>After various other observations interchanged in a similar tenor, the
Athenian envoys, strenuously urging upon the Melians to reconsider
the matter more cautiously among themselves, withdrew, and after a
certain interval were recalled by the Melian council to hear the
following words: “We hold to the same opinion, as at first, men of
Athens: we shall not surrender the independence of a city which
has already stood for seven hundred years; we shall yet make an
effort to save ourselves, relying on that favorable fortune which
the gods have hitherto vouchsafed to us, as well as upon aid from
men, and especially from the Lacedæmonians. We request that we may
be considered as your friends, but as hostile to neither party, and
that you will leave the island after concluding such a truce as may
be mutually acceptable.”—“Well (said the Athenian envoys), you alone
seem to consider future contingencies as clearer than the facts
before your eyes, and to look at an uncertain distance, through your
own wishes, as if it were present reality. You have staked your all
upon the Lacedæmonians, upon fortune, and upon fond hopes; and, with
your all, you will come to ruin.”</p>

<p>The siege was forthwith commenced. A wall of circumvallation,
distributed in portions among the different allies of Athens, was
constructed round the town; which was left under full blockade, both
by sea and land, while the rest of the armament retired home. The
town remained blocked up for several months. During the course of
that time, the besieged made two successful sallies, which afforded
them some temporary relief, and forced the Athenians to send an
additional detachment, under Philokratês. At length the provisions
within were exhausted;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[p.
114]</span> plots for betrayal commenced among the Melians
themselves, so that they were constrained to surrender at discretion.
The Athenians resolved to put to death all the men of military age
and to sell the women and children as slaves. Who the proposer
of this barbarous resolution was, Thucydidês does not say; but
Plutarch and others inform us that Alkibiadês<a id="FNanchor_162"
href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> was strenuous in
supporting it. Five hundred Athenian settlers were subsequently
sent thither, to form a new community: apparently not as kleruchs,
or out-citizens of Athens, but as new Melians.<a id="FNanchor_163"
href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Taking the proceedings of the Athenians towards Mêlos from
the beginning to the end, they form one of the grossest and most
inexcusable pieces of cruelty combined with injustice which Grecian
history presents to us. In appreciating the cruelty of such
wholesale executions, we ought to recollect that the laws of war
placed the prisoner altogether at the disposal of his conqueror,
and that an Athenian garrison, if captured by the Corinthians in
Naupaktus, Nisæa, or elsewhere, would assuredly have undergone the
same fate, unless in so far as they might be kept for exchange.
But the treatment of the Melians goes beyond all rigor of the laws
of war; for they had never been at war with Athens, nor had they
done anything to incur her enmity. Moreover, the acquisition of the
island was of no material value to Athens; not sufficient to pay the
expenses of the armament employed in its capture. And while the gain
was thus in every sense slender, the shock to Grecian feeling by the
whole proceeding seems to have occasioned serious mischief to Athens.
Far from tending to strengthen her entire empire, by sweeping in this
small insular population, who had hitherto been neutral and harmless,
it raised nothing but odium against her, and was treasured up in
after times as among the first of her misdeeds.</p>

<p>To gratify her pride of empire by a new conquest—easy to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[p. 115]</span> effect, though of small
value—was doubtless her chief motive; probably also strengthened by
pique against Sparta, between whom and herself a thoroughly hostile
feeling subsisted, and by a desire to humiliate Sparta through the
Melians. This passion for new acquisition, superseding the more
reasonable hopes of recovering the lost portions of her empire, will
be seen in the coming chapters breaking out with still more fatal
predominance.</p>

<p>Both these two points, it will be observed, are prominently
marked in the dialogue set forth by Thucydidês. I have already
stated that this dialogue can hardly represent what actually
passed, except as to a few general points, which the historian has
followed out into deductions and illustrations,<a id="FNanchor_164"
href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> thus dramatizing
the given situation in a powerful and characteristic manner. The
language put into the mouth of the Athenian envoys is that of pirates
and robbers, as Dionysius of Halikarnassus<a id="FNanchor_165"
href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> long ago remarked;
intimating his suspicion that Thucydidês had so set out the case
for the purpose of discrediting the country which had sent him
into exile. Whatever may be thought of this suspicion, we may at
least affirm that the arguments which he here ascribes to Athens
are not in harmony even with the defects of the Athenian character.
Athenian speakers are more open to the charge of equivocal wording,
multiplication of false pretences, softening down the bad points of
their case, putting an amiable name upon vicious acts, employing
what is properly called <i>sophistry</i>, where their purpose needs it.<a
id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Now
the language of the envoy at Mêlos, which has been sometimes cited as
illustrating the immorality of the class or profession—falsely called
a school—named Sophists at Athens, is above all things remarkable for
a sort of audacious frankness; a disdain not merely of sophistry,
in the modern sense of the word, but even<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_116">[p. 116]</span> of such plausible excuse as might
have been offered. It has been strangely argued, as if “<i>The good
old plan, that they should take who have the power, and they should
keep who can</i>,” had been first discovered and openly promulgated by
Athenian sophists; whereas the true purpose and value of sophists,
even in the modern and worst sense of the word—putting aside the
perversion of applying that sense to the persons called sophists at
Athens—is, to furnish plausible matter of deceptive justification, so
that the strong man may be enabled to act upon this “good old plan”
as much as he pleases, but without avowing it, and while professing
fair dealing or just retaliation for some imaginary wrong. The wolf
in Æsop’s fable (of the Wolf and the Lamb) speaks like a sophist; the
Athenian envoy at Mêlos speaks in a manner totally unlike a sophist,
either in the Athenian sense or in the modern sense of the word; we
may add, unlike an Athenian at all, as Dionysius has observed.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact and practice, it is true that stronger states,
in Greece and in the contemporary world, did habitually tend, as they
have tended throughout the course of history down to the present day,
to enlarge their power at the expense of the weaker. Every territory
in Greece, except Attica and Arcadia, had been seized by conquerors
who dispossessed or enslaved the prior inhabitants. We find Brasidas
reminding his soldiers of the good sword of their forefathers,
which had established dominion over men far more numerous than
themselves, as matter of pride and glory:<a id="FNanchor_167"
href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and when we come
to the times of Philip and Alexander of Macedon, we shall see the
lust of conquest reaching a pitch never witnessed among free Greeks.
Of right thus founded on simple superiority of force, there were
abundant examples to be quoted, as parallels to the Athenian conquest
of Mêlos: but that which is unparalleled is the mode adopted by
the Athenian envoy of justifying it, or rather of setting aside
all justification, looking at the actual state of civilization in
Greece. A barbarous invader casts his sword into the scale in lieu of
argument: a civilized conqueror is bound by received international
morality to furnish some justification,—a good plea, if he can,—a
false<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[p. 117]</span> plea, or
sham plea, if he has no better. But the Athenian envoy neither copies
the contemptuous silence of the barbarian nor the smooth lying of the
civilized invader. Though coming from the most cultivated city in
Greece, where the vices prevalent were those of refinement and not of
barbarism, he disdains the conventional arts of civilized diplomacy
more than would have been done by an envoy even of Argos or Korkyra.
He even disdains to mention, what might have been said with perfect
truth as a matter of fact, whatever may be thought of its sufficiency
as a justification, that the Melians had enjoyed for the last fifty
years the security of the Ægean waters at the cost of Athens and her
allies, without any payment of their own.</p>

<p>So at least he is made to do in the Thucydidean dramatic
fragment,—Μήλου Ἅλωσις (The Capture of Melos),—if we may parody the
title of the lost tragedy of Phrynichus “The Capture of Miletus.”
And I think a comprehensive view of the history of Thucydidês will
suggest to us the explanation of this drama, with its powerful and
tragical effect. The capture of Mêlos comes immediately before the
great Athenian expedition against Syracuse, which was resolved upon
three or four months afterwards, and despatched during the course
of the following summer. That expedition was the gigantic effort
of Athens, which ended in the most ruinous catastrophe known to
ancient history. From such a blow it was impossible for Athens to
recover. Though thus crippled, indeed, she struggled against its
effects with surprising energy; but her fortune went on, in the main,
declining,—yet with occasional moments of apparent restoration,—until
her complete prostration and subjugation by Lysander. Now Thucydidês,
just before he gets upon the plane of this descending progress,
makes a halt, to illustrate the sentiment of Athenian power in
its most exaggerated, insolent, and cruel manifestation, by this
dramatic fragment of the envoys at Mêlos. It will be recollected that
Herodotus, when about to describe the forward march of Xerxês into
Greece, destined to terminate in such fatal humiliation, impresses
his readers with an elaborate idea of the monarch’s insolence and
superhuman pride, by various conversations between him and the
courtiers about him, as well as by other anecdotes, combined with
the overwhelming specifications of the muster at Doriskus. Such
moral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[p. 118]</span> contrasts
and juxtapositions, especially that of ruinous reverse following
upon overweening good fortune, were highly interesting to the Greek
mind. And Thucydidês—having before him an act of great injustice
and cruelty on the part of Athens, committed exactly at this point
of time—has availed himself of the form of dialogue, for once
in his history, to bring out the sentiments of a disdainful and
confident conqueror in dramatic antithesis. They are, however, his
own sentiments, conceived as suitable to the situation; not those of
the Athenian envoy,—still less, those of the Athenian public,—least
of all, those of that much-calumniated class of men, the Athenian
sophists.</p>

  SICILIAN AFFAIRS AFTER THE EXTINCTION OF THE GELONIAN DYNASTY.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span>
the preceding chapters, I have brought down the general history of
the Peloponnesian war to the time immediately preceding the memorable
Athenian expedition against Syracuse, which changed the whole face of
the war. At this period, and for some time to come, the history of
the Peloponnesian Greeks becomes intimately blended with that of the
Sicilian Greeks. But hitherto the connection between the two has been
merely occasional, and of little reciprocal effect: so that I have
thought it for the convenience of the reader to keep the two streams
entirely separate, omitting the proceedings of Athens in Sicily
during the first ten years of the war. I now proceed to fill up this
blank: to recount as much as can be made out of Sicilian events
during the interval between 461-416 <small>B.C.</small>,
and to assign the successive steps whereby the Athenians entangled
themselves in ambitious projects against Syracuse, until they at
length came to stake the larger portion of their force upon that
fatal hazard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[p. 119]</span></p>

<p>The extinction of the Gelonian dynasty at Syracuse,<a
id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
followed by the expulsion or retirement of all the other despots
throughout the island, left the various Grecian cities to reorganize
themselves in free and self-constituted governments. Unfortunately,
our memorials respecting this revolution are miserably scanty; but
there is enough to indicate that it was something much more than
a change from single-headed to popular government. It included,
farther, transfers on the largest scale both of inhabitants and of
property. The preceding despots had sent many old citizens into
exile, transplanted others from one part of Sicily to another,
and provided settlements for numerous emigrants and mercenaries
devoted to their interest. Of these proceedings much was reversed,
when the dynasties were overthrown, so that the personal and
proprietary revolution was more complicated and perplexing than the
political. After a period of severe commotion, an accommodation was
concluded, whereby the adherents of the expelled dynasty were planted
partly in the territory of Messêne, partly in the reëstablished
city of Kamarina in the eastern portion of the southern coast,
bordering on Syracuse.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169"
class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[p. 120]</span></p>

<p>But though peace was thus reëstablished, these large mutations
of inhabitants first begun by the despots,—and the incoherent
mixture of races, religious institutions, dialects, etc., which
was brought about unavoidably during the process,—left throughout
Sicily a feeling of local instability, very different from
the long traditional tenures in Peloponnesus and Attica, and
numbered by foreign enemies among the elements of its weakness.<a
id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
The wonder indeed rather is, that such real and powerful causes
of disorder were soon so efficaciously controlled by the popular
governments, that the half century now approaching was decidedly
the most prosperous and undisturbed period in the history of the
island.</p>

<p>The southern coast of Sicily was occupied, beginning from the
westward by Selinus, Agrigentum, Gela, and Kamarina. Then came
Syracuse, possessing the southeastern cape, and the southern portion
of the eastern coast: next, on the eastern coast, Leontini, Katana,
and Naxos: Messênê, on the strait adjoining Italy. The centre of the
island, and even much of the northern coast, was occupied by the
non-Hellenic Sikels and Sikans: on this coast, Himera was the only
Grecian city. Between Himera and Cape Lilybæum, the western corner
of the island was occupied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[p.
121]</span> by the non-Hellenic cities of Egesta and Eryx, and by
the Carthaginian seaports, of which Panormus (Palermo) was the
principal.</p>

<p>Of these various Grecian cities, all independent, Syracuse
was the first in power, Agrigentum the second. The causes above
noticed, disturbing the first commencement of popular governments
in all of them, were most powerfully operative at Syracuse. We do
not know the particulars of the democratical constitution which was
there established, but its stability was threatened by more than
one ambitious pretender, eager to seize the sceptre of Gelo and
Hiero. The most prominent among these pretenders was Tyndarion,
who employed a considerable fortune in distributing largesses and
procuring partisans among the poor. His political designs were at
length so openly manifested, that he was brought to trial, condemned,
and put to death; yet not without an abortive insurrection of his
partisans to rescue him. After several leading citizens had tried,
and failed in a similar manner, the people thought it expedient
to pass a law similar to the Athenian ostracism, authorizing the
infliction of temporary preventive banishment.<a id="FNanchor_171"
href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Under this law
several powerful citizens were actually and speedily banished; and
such was the abuse of the new engine, by the political parties in
the city, that men of conspicuous position are said to have become
afraid of meddling with public affairs. Thus put in practice, the
institution is said to have given rise to new political contentions
not less violent than those which it checked, insomuch that the
Syracusans found themselves obliged to repeal the law not long
after its introduction. We should have been glad to learn some
particulars concerning this political experiment, beyond the meagre
abstract given by Diodorus, and especially to know the precautionary
securities by which the application of the ostracizing sentence
was restrained at Syracuse. Perhaps no care was taken to copy the
checks and formalities provided by Kleisthenês at Athens. Yet under
all circumstances, the institution, though tutelary, if reserved
for its proper emergencies, was eminently<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_122">[p. 122]</span> open to abuse, so that we have no
reason to wonder that abuse occurred, especially at a period of great
violence and discord. The wonder rather is, that it was so little
abused at Athens.</p>

<p>Although the ostracism, or petalism, at Syracuse was speedily
discontinued, it may probably have left a salutary impression behind,
as far as we can judge from the fact that new pretenders to despotism
are not hereafter mentioned. The republic increases in wealth, and
manifests an energetic action in foreign affairs. The Syracusan
admiral Phaӱllus was despatched with a powerful fleet to repress
the piracies of the Tyrrhenian maritime towns, and after ravaging
the island of Elba, returned home, under the suspicion of having
been bought off by bribes from the enemy; on which accusation he was
tried and banished, a second fleet of sixty triremes under Apellês
being sent to the same regions. The new admiral not only plundered
many parts of the Tyrrhenian coast, but also carried his ravages
into the island of Corsica, at that time a Tyrrhenian possession,
and reduced the island of Elba completely. His return was signalized
by a large number of captives and a rich booty.<a id="FNanchor_172"
href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the great antecedent revolutions, among the Grecian
cities in Sicily had raised a new spirit among the Sikels of the
interior, and inspired the Sikel prince Duketius, a man of spirit
and ability, with large ideas of aggrandizement. Many exiled Greeks
having probably sought service with him, it was either by their
suggestion, or from having himself caught the spirit of Hellenic
improvement, that he commenced the plan of bringing the petty Sikel
communities into something like city life and collective coöperation.
Having acquired glory by the capture of the Grecian town of
Morgantina, he induced all the Sikel communities, with the exception
of Hybla, to enter into a sort of federative compact. Next, in order
to obtain a central point for the new organization, he transferred
his own little town from the hill-top, called Menæ, down to a
convenient spot of the neighboring plain, near to the sacred precinct
of the gods called Paliki.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173"
class="fnanchor">[173]</a> As the veneration paid to these gods,
determined in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[p. 123]</span>
part by the striking volcanic manifestations in the neighborhood,
rendered this plain a suitable point of attraction for Sikels
generally, Duketius was enabled to establish a considerable new city
of Palikê, with walls of large circumference, and an ample range of
adjacent land which he distributed among a numerous Sikel population,
probably with some Greeks intermingled.</p>

<p>The powerful position which Duketius had thus acquired is
attested by the aggressive character of his measures, intended
gradually to recover a portion at least of that ground which the
Greeks had appropriated at the expense of the indigenous population.
The Sikel town of Ennesia had been seized by the Hieronian Greeks
expelled from Ætna, and had received from them the name of Ætna:<a
id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
Duketius now found means to reconquer it, after ensnaring by
stratagem the leading magistrate. He was next bold enough to invade
the territory of the Agrigentines, and to besiege one of their
country garrisons called Motyum. We are impressed with a high idea
of his power, when we learn that the Agrigentines, while marching
to relieve the place, thought it necessary to invoke aid from the
Syracusans, who sent to them a force under Bolkon. Over this united
force Duketius gained a victory, in consequence of the treason or
cowardice of Bolkon, as the Syracusans believed, insomuch that
they condemned him to death. In the succeeding year, however, the
good fortune of the Sikel prince changed. The united army of these
two powerful cities raised the blockade of Motyum, completely
defeated him in the field, and dispersed all his forces. Finding
himself deserted by his comrades and even on the point of being
betrayed, he took the desperate resolution of casting himself upon
the mercy of the Syracusans. He rode off by night to the gates of
Syracuse, entered the city unknown, and sat down as a suppliant on
the altar in the agora, surrendering himself together with all his
territory. A spectacle thus unexpected brought together a crowd of
Syracuse citizens, exciting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[p.
124]</span> in them the strongest emotions: and when the magistrates
convened the assembly for the purpose of deciding his fate, the
voice of mercy was found paramount, in spite of the contrary
recommendations of some of the political leaders. The most respected
among the elder citizens—earnestly recommending mild treatment
towards a foe thus fallen and suppliant, coupled with scrupulous
regard not to bring upon the city the avenging hand of Nemesis—found
their appeal to the generous sentiment of the people welcomed by
one unanimous cry of “Save the suppliant.”<a id="FNanchor_175"
href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Duketius, withdrawn
from the altar, was sent off to Corinth, under his engagement to
live there quietly for the future; the Syracusans providing for his
comfortable maintenance.</p>

<p>Amidst the cruelty habitual in ancient warfare, this remarkable
incident excites mingled surprise and admiration. Doubtless the
lenient impulse of the people mainly arose from their seeing Duketius
actually before them in suppliant posture at their altar, instead
of being called upon to determine his fate in his absence,—just
as the Athenian people were in like manner moved by the actual
sight of the captive Dorieus, and induced to spare his life, on an
occasion which will be hereafter recounted.<a id="FNanchor_176"
href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> If in some instances
the assembled people, obeying the usual vehemence of multitudinous
sentiment, carried severities to excess,—so, in other cases, as well
as in this, the appeal to their humane impulses will be found to have
triumphed over prudential regard for future security. Such was the
fruit which the Syracusans reaped for sparing Duketius, who, after
residing a year or two at Corinth, violated his parole. Pretending
to have received an order from the oracle, he assembled a number of
colonists, whom he conducted into Sicily to found a city at Kalê Aktê
on the northern coast belonging to the Sikels. We cannot doubt that
when the Syracusans found in what manner their lenity was requited,
the speakers who had recommended severe treatment would take great
credit on the score of superior foresight.<a id="FNanchor_177"
href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[p. 125]</span></p>

<p>But the return of this energetic enemy was not the only mischief
which the Syracusans suffered. Their resolution to spare Duketius
had been adopted without the concurrence of the Agrigentines, who
had helped to conquer him; and the latter, when they saw him again
in the island, and again formidable, were so indignant that they
declared war against Syracuse. A standing jealousy prevailed between
these two great cities, the first and second powers in Sicily. War
actually broke out between them, wherein other Greek cities took
part. After lasting some time, with various acts of hostility, and
especially a serious defeat of the Agrigentines at the river Himera,
these latter solicited and obtained peace.<a id="FNanchor_178"
href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The discord between
the two cities, however, had left leisure to Duketius to found the
city of Kalê Aktê, and to make some progress in reëstablishing his
ascendency over the Sikels, in which operation he was overtaken
by death. He probably left no successor to carry on his plans, so
that the Syracusans, pressing their attacks vigorously, reduced
many of the Sikel townships in the island, regaining his former
conquest, Morgantinê, and subduing even the strong position and
town called Trinakia,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179"
class="fnanchor">[179]</a> after a brave and desperate resistance on
the part of the inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[p. 126]</span></p>

<p>By this large accession both of subjects and of tribute, combined
with her recent victory over Agrigentum, Syracuse was elevated to
the height of power, and began to indulge schemes for extending her
ascendency throughout the island: with which view her horsemen were
doubled in number, and one hundred new triremes were constructed.<a
id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
Whether any, or what, steps were taken to realize her designs our
historian does not tell us. But the position of Sicily remains the
same at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war: Syracuse, the first
city as to power, indulging in ambitious dreams, if not in ambitious
aggressions; Agrigentum, a jealous second, and almost a rival; the
remaining Grecian states maintaining their independence, yet not
without mistrust and apprehension.</p>

<p>Though the particular phenomena of this period, however, have
not come to our knowledge, we see enough to prove that it was
one of great prosperity for Sicily. The wealth, commerce, and
public monuments of Agrigentum, especially appear to have even
surpassed those of the Syracusans. Her trade with Carthage and the
African coast was both extensive and profitable; for at this time
neither the vine nor the olive were much cultivated in Libya, and
the Carthaginians derived their wine and oil from the southern
territory of Sicily,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181"
class="fnanchor">[181]</a> particularly that of Agrigentum. The
temples of the city, among which that of Olympic Zeus stood foremost,
were on the grandest scale of magnificence, surpassing everything
of the kind in Sicily. The population of the city, free as well as
slave, was very great: the number of rich men keeping chariots and
competing for the prize at the Olympic games was renowned, not less
than the accumulation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[p.
127]</span> works of art, statues and pictures,<a id="FNanchor_182"
href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> with manifold
insignia of ornament and luxury. All this is particularly brought
to our notice because of the frightful catastrophe which desolated
Agrigentum in 406 <small>B.C.</small> from the hands of
the Carthaginians. It was in the interval which we are now describing
that this prosperity was accumulated; doubtless not in Agrigentum
alone, but more or less throughout all the Grecian cities of the
island.</p>

<p>Nor was it only in material prosperity that they were
distinguished. At this time, the intellectual movement in some of the
Italian and Sicilian towns was very considerable. The inconsiderable
town of Elea in the gulf of Poseidonia nourished two of the greatest
speculative philosophers in Greece, Parmenidês and Zeno. Empedoklês
of Agrigentum was hardly less eminent in the same department, yet
combining with it a political and practical efficiency. The popular
character of the Sicilian governments stimulated the cultivation
of rhetorical studies, wherein not only Empedoklês and Pôlus at
Agrigentum, but Tisias and Korax at Syracuse, and still more,
Gorgias at Leontini, acquired great reputation.<a id="FNanchor_183"
href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> The constitution
established at Agrigentum after the dispossession of the Theronian
dynasty was at first not thoroughly democratical, the principal
authority residing in a large Senate of One Thousand members. We
are told even that an ambitious club of citizens were aiming at the
reëstablishment of a despotism, when Empedoklês, availing himself of
wealth and high position, took the lead in a popular opposition; so
as not only to defeat this intrigue, but also to put down the Senate
of One Thousand, and render the government completely democratical.
His influence over the people was enhanced by the vein of mysticism,
and pretence to miraculous or divine endowments, which accompanied
his philosophical speculations, in a manner<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_128">[p. 128]</span> similar to Pythagoras.<a
id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
The same combination of rhetoric with physical speculation appears
also in Gorgias of Leontini, whose celebrity as a teacher throughout
Greece was both greater and earlier than that of any one else. It
was a similar demand for popular speaking in the assembly and the
judicatures which gave encouragement to the rhetorical teachers
Tisias and Korax at Syracuse.</p>

<p>In this state of material prosperity, popular politics, and
intellectual activity, the Sicilian towns were found at the breaking
out of the great struggle between Athens and the Peloponnesian
confederacy in 431 <small>B.C.</small> In that
struggle the Italian and Sicilian Greeks had no direct concern,
nor anything to fear from the ambition of Athens; who, though
she had founded Thurii in 443 <small>B.C.</small>,
appears to have never aimed at any political ascendency even over
that town, much less anywhere else on the coast. But the Sicilian
Greeks, though forming a system apart in their own island, from
which it suited the dominant policy of Syracuse to exclude all
foreign interference,<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185"
class="fnanchor">[185]</a> were yet connected, by sympathy, and on
one side even by alliances, with the two main streams of Hellenic
politics. Among the allies of Sparta were numbered all or most of
the Dorian cities of Sicily,—Syracuse, Kamarina, Gela, Agrigentum,
Selinus, perhaps Himera and Messênê,—together with Lokri and Tarentum
in Italy: among the allies of Athens, perhaps the Chalkidic or
Ionic Rhegium in Italy.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186"
class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Whether the Ionic cities in Sicily—Naxos,
Katana, and Leontini—were at this time united with Athens by any
special treaty, is very doubtful. But if we examine the state of
politics prior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[p. 129]</span> to
the breaking out of the war, it will be found that the connection of
the Sicilian cities on both sides with Central Greece was rather one
of sympathy and tendency than of pronounced obligation and action.
The Dorian Sicilians, though doubtless sharing the antipathy of the
Peloponnesian Dorians to Athens, had never been called upon for any
coöperation with Sparta; nor had the Ionic Sicilians yet learned
to look to Athens for protection against their powerful neighbor
Syracuse.</p>

<p>It was the memorable quarrel between Corinth and Korkyra, and the
intervention of Athens in that quarrel (<small>B.C.</small> 433-432),
which brought the Sicilian parties one step nearer to coöperation in
the Peloponnesian quarrel, in two different ways; first, by exciting
the most violent anti-Athenian war spirit in Corinth, with whom
the Sicilian Dorians held their chief commerce and sympathy,—next,
by providing a basis for the action of Athenian maritime force in
Italy and Sicily, which would have been impracticable without an
established footing in Korkyra. But Plutarch—whom most historians
have followed—is mistaken, and is contradicted by Thucydidês, when
he ascribes to the Athenians at this time ambitious projects in
Sicily of the nature of those which they came to conceive seven
or eight years afterwards. At the outbreak, and for some years
before the outbreak, of the war, the policy of Athens was purely
conservative, and that of her enemies aggressive, as I have shown
in a former chapter. At that moment, Sparta and Corinth anticipated
large assistance from the Sicilian Dorians, in ships of war, in
money, and in provisions; while the value of Korkyra as an ally
of Athens consisted in affording facilities for obstructing such
reinforcements, far more than from any anticipated conquests.<a
id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[p. 130]</span></p> <p>In
the spring of 431 <small>B.C.</small>, the Spartans, then organizing
their first invasion of Attica, and full of hope that Athens would
be crushed in one or two campaigns, contemplated the building of a
vast fleet of five hundred ships of war among the confederacy. A
considerable portion of this charge was imposed upon the Italian
and Sicilian Dorians, and a contribution in money besides; with
instructions to refrain from any immediate declaration against
Athens until their fleet should be ready.<a id="FNanchor_188"
href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Of such expected
succor, indeed, little was ever realized in any way; in ships,
nothing at all. But the expectations and orders of Sparta, show<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[p. 131]</span> that here as elsewhere
she was then on the offensive, and Athens only on the defensive.
Probably the Corinthians had encouraged the expectation of ample
reinforcements from Syracuse and the neighboring towns, a hope
which must have contributed largely to the confidence with which
they began the struggle. What were the causes which prevented
it from being realized, we are not distinctly told; and we find
Hermokratês the Syracusan reproaching his countrymen fifteen years
afterwards, immediately before the great Athenian expedition
against Syracuse, with their antecedent apathy.<a id="FNanchor_189"
href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> But it is easy to
see, that as the Sicilian Greeks had no direct interest in the
contest,—neither wrongs to avenge, nor dangers to apprehend, from
Athens,—nor any habit of obeying requisitions from Sparta, so they
might naturally content themselves with expressions of sympathy and
promises of aid in case of need, without taxing themselves to the
enormous extent which it pleased Sparta to impose, for purposes both
aggressive and purely Peloponnesian. Perhaps the leading men in
Syracuse, from attachment to Corinth, may have sought to act upon
the order. But no similar motive would be found operative either at
Agrigentum or at Gela or Selinus.</p>

<p>Though the order was not executed, however, there can be little
doubt that it was publicly announced and threatened, thus becoming
known to the Ionic cities in Sicily as well as to Athens; and that
it weighed materially in determining the latter afterwards to
assist those cities, when they sent to invoke her aid. Instead of
despatching their forces to Peloponnesus, where they had nothing
to gain, the Sicilian Dorians preferred attacking the Ionic cities
in their own island, whose territory they might have reasonable
hopes of conquering and appropriating,—Naxos, Katana, and Leontini.
These cities doubtless sympathized with Athens in her struggle
against Sparta; yet, far from being strong enough to assist her
or to threaten their Dorian neighbors, they were unable to defend
themselves without Athenian aid. They were assisted by the Dorian
city of Kamarina, which was afraid of her powerful border city
Syracuse, and by Rhegium in Italy; while Lokri in Italy, the bitter
enemy of Rhegium, sided with Syracuse against them. In the fifth
summer of the war, finding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[p.
132]</span> themselves blockaded by sea and confined to their
walls, they sent to Athens, both to entreat succor, as allies<a
id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> and
Ionians, and to represent that, if Syracuse succeeded in crushing
them, she and the other Dorians in Sicily would forthwith send over
the positive aid which the Peloponnesians had so long been invoking.
The eminent rhetor Gorgias of Leontini, whose peculiar style of
speaking is said to have been new to the Athenian assembly, and to
have produced a powerful effect, was at the head of this embassy.
It is certain that this rhetor procured for himself numerous
pupils and large gains, not merely in Athens but in many other
towns of Central Greece,<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191"
class="fnanchor">[191]</a> though it is exaggeration to ascribe to
his pleading the success of the present application.</p>

<p>Now the Athenians had a real interest as well in protecting these
Ionic Sicilians from being conquered by the Dorians in the island,
as in obstructing the transport of Sicilian corn to Peloponnesus:
and they sent twenty triremes under Lachês and Charœadês, with
instructions, while accomplishing these objects, to ascertain the
possibility of going beyond the defensive, and making conquests.
Taking station at Rhegium, Lachês did something towards rescuing
the Ionic cities in part from their maritime blockade, and even
undertook an abortive expedition against the Lipari isles, which were
in alliance with Syracuse.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192"
class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Throughout the ensuing year, he pressed
the war in the neighborhood of Rhegium and Messênê, his colleague
Charœadês being slain. Attacking Mylæ in the Messenian territory, he
was fortunate enough to gain so decisive an advantage over the troops
of Messênê, that that city itself capitulated to him, gave hostages,
and enrolled itself as ally of Athens and the Ionic cities.<a
id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> He
also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[p. 133]</span> contracted
an alliance with the non-Hellenic city of Egesta, in the northwest
portion of Sicily, and he invaded the territory of Lokri, capturing
one of the country forts on the river Halex:<a id="FNanchor_194"
href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> after which, in a
second debarkation, he defeated a Lokrian detachment under Proxenus.
But he was unsuccessful in an expedition into the interior of Sicily
against Inêssus. This was a native Sikel township, held in coercion
by a Syracusan garrison in the acropolis; which the Athenians vainly
attempted to storm, being repulsed with loss.<a id="FNanchor_195"
href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Lachês concluded his
operations in the autumn by an ineffective incursion on the territory
of Himera and on the Lipari isles. On returning to Rhegium at the
beginning of the ensuing year (<small>B.C.</small> 425),
he found Pythodôrus already arrived from Athens to supersede him.<a
id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>That officer had come as the forerunner of a more considerable
expedition, intended to arrive in the spring, under Eurymedon
and Sophoklês, who were to command in conjunction with himself.
The Ionic cities in Sicily, finding the squadron under Lachês
insufficient to render them a match for their enemies at sea, had
been emboldened to send a second embassy to Athens, with request for
farther reinforcements, at the same time making increased efforts
to enlarge their own naval force. It happened that at this moment
the Athenians had no special employment elsewhere for their fleet,
which they desired to keep in constant practice. They accordingly
resolved to send to Sicily forty additional triremes, in full hopes
of bringing the contest to a speedy close.<a id="FNanchor_197"
href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>Early in the ensuing spring, Eurymedon and Sophoklês started from
Athens for Sicily in command of this squadron, with instructions
to afford relief at Korkyra in their way, and with Demosthenês
on board to act on the coast of Peloponnesus. It was this fleet
which, in conjunction with the land-forces under the command of
Kleon, making a descent almost by accident on the Laconian coast
at Pylos, achieved for Athens the most signal success of the whole
war, the capture of the Lacedæmonian hoplites in Sphakteria.<a
id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
But the fleet was so long occupied, first in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_134">[p. 134]</span> the blockade of that island, next in
operations at Korkyra, that it did not reach Sicily until about
the month of September.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199"
class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>Such delay, eminently advantageous for Athens generally, was
fatal to her hopes of success in Sicily during the whole summer. For
Pythodôrus, acting only with the fleet previously commanded by Lachês
at Rhegium, was not merely defeated in a descent upon Lokri, but
experienced a more irreparable loss by the revolt of Messênê, which
had surrendered to Lachês a few months before; and which, together
with Rhegium, had given to the Athenians the command of the strait.
Apprized of the coming Athenian fleet, the Syracusans were anxious
to deprive them of this important base of operations against the
island; and a fleet of twenty sail—half Syracusan, half Lokrian—was
enabled by the concurrence of a party in Messênê to seize the town.
It would appear that the Athenian fleet was then at Rhegium, but that
town was at the same time threatened by the entrance of the entire
land-force of Lokri, together with a body of Rhegine exiles: these
latter were even not without hopes of obtaining admission by means of
a favorable party in the town. Though such hopes were disappointed,
yet the diversion prevented all succor from Rhegium to Messênê. The
latter town now served as a harbor for the fleet hostile to Athens,<a
id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
which was speedily reinforced to more than thirty sail, and began
maritime operations forthwith, in hopes of crushing the Athenians
and capturing Rhegium, before Eurymedon should arrive. But the
Athenians, though they had only sixteen triremes together with eight
others from Rhegium, gained a decided victory, in an action brought
on accidentally for the possession of a merchantman sailing through
the strait. They put the enemy’s ships to flight, and drove them
to seek refuge, some under protection of the Syracusan land-force
at Cape Pelôrus near Messênê, others under the Lokrian force near
Rhegium, each as they best could, with the loss of one trireme.<a
id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
This de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[p. 135]</span>feat so
broke up the scheme of Lokrian operations against the latter place,
that their land-force retired from the Rhegine territory, while the
whole defeated squadron was reunited on the opposite coast under
Cape Pelôrus. Here the ships were moored close on shore under the
protection of the land-force, when the Athenians and Rhegines came up
to attack them; but without success, and even with the loss of one
trireme, which the men on shore contrived to seize and detain by a
grappling-iron; her crew escaping by swimming to the vessels of their
comrades. Having repulsed the enemy, the Syracusans got aboard, and
rowed close along-shore, partly aided by tow-ropes, to the harbor of
Messênê, in which transit they were again attacked, but the Athenians
were a second time beaten off with the loss of another ship. Their
superior seamanship was of no avail in this along-shore fighting.<a
id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>The Athenian fleet was now suddenly withdrawn in order to prevent
an intended movement in Kamarina, where a philo-Syracusan party under
Archias threatened revolt: and the Messenian forces, thus left free,
invaded the territory of their neighbor, the Chalkidic city of Naxos,
sending their fleet round to the mouth of the Akesinês near that
city. They were ravaging the lands, and were preparing to storm the
town, when a considerable body of the indigenous Sikels were seen
descending the neighboring hills to succor the Naxians: upon which
the latter, elate with the sight, and mistaking the new comers for
their Grecian brethren from Leontini, rushed out of the gates and
made a vigorous sally at a moment when their enemies were unprepared.
The Messenians were completely defeated, with the loss of no less
than one thousand men, and with a still greater loss sustained
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[p. 136]</span> their retreat
home from the pursuit of the Sikels. Their fleet went back also to
Messênê, from whence such of the ships as were not Messenian returned
home. So much was the city weakened by its recent defeat, that a
Lokrian garrison was sent for its protection under Demomelês, while
the Leontines and Naxians, together with the Athenian squadron on
returning from Kamarina, attacked it by land and sea in this moment
of distress. A well-timed sally of the Messenians and Lokrians,
however, dispersed the Leontine land-force; but the Athenian force,
landing from their ships, attacked the assailants while in the
disorder of pursuit, and drove them back within the walls. The scheme
against Messênê, however, had now become impracticable, so that
the Athenians crossed the strait to Rhegium.<a id="FNanchor_203"
href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>Thus indecisive was the result of operations in Sicily, during
the first half of the seventh year of the Peloponnesian war: nor
does it appear that the Athenians undertook anything considerable
during the autumnal half, though the full fleet under Eurymedon had
then joined Pythodôrus.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204"
class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Yet while the presence of so large an
Athenian fleet at Rhegium would produce considerable effect upon
the Syracusan mind, the triumphant promise of Athenian affairs, and
the astonishing humiliation of Sparta during the months immediately
following the capture of Sphakteria, probably struck much deeper.
In the spring of the eighth year of the war, Athens was not only in
possession of the Spartan prisoners, but also of Pylos and Kythêra,
so that a rising among the Helots appeared noway improbable. She was
in the full swing of hope, while her discouraged enemies were all
thrown on the defensive. Hence the Sicilian Dorians, intimidated by a
state of affairs so different from that in which they had begun the
war three years before, were now eager to bring about a pacification
in their island.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205"
class="fnanchor">[205]</a> The Dorian city of Kamarina, which had
hitherto acted along with the Ionic or Chalkidic cities, was the
first to make a separate accommodation with its neighboring city
of Gela; at which latter place deputies were invited to attend
from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[p. 137]</span> all the
cities in the island, with a view to the conclusion of peace.<a
id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>This congress met in the spring of 424 <small>B.C.</small>, when
Syracuse, the most powerful city in Sicily, took the lead in urging
the common interest which all had in the conclusion of peace. The
Syracusan Hermokratês, chief adviser of this policy in his native
city, now appeared to vindicate and enforce it in the congress. He
was a well-born, brave, and able man, clear-sighted in regard to the
foreign interests of his country; but at the same time of pronounced
oligarchical sentiments, mistrusted by the people, seemingly with
good reason, in regard to their internal constitution. The speech
which Thucydidês places in his mouth, on the present occasion,
sets forth emphatically the necessity of keeping Sicily at all
cost free from foreign intervention, and of settling at home all
differences which might arise between the various Sicilian cities.
Hermokratês impressed upon his hearers that the aggressive schemes
of Athens, now the greatest power in Greece, were directed against
all Sicily, and threatened all cities alike, Ionians not less than
Dorians. If they enfeebled one another by internal quarrels, and
then invited the Athenians as arbitrators, the result would be ruin
and slavery to all. The Athenians were but too ready to encroach
everywhere, even without invitation: they had now come, with a zeal
outrunning all obligation, under pretence of aiding the Chalkidic
cities who had never aided them, but in the real hope of achieving
conquest for themselves. The Chalkidic cities must not rely upon
their Ionic kindred for security against evil designs on the part
of Athens: as Sicilians, they had a paramount interest in upholding
the independence of the island. If possible, they ought to maintain
undisturbed peace; but if that were impossible, it was essential at
least to confine the war to Sicily, apart from any foreign intruders.
Complaints should be exchanged, and injuries redressed, by all,
in a spirit of mutual forbearance; of which Syracuse—the first
city in the island, and best able to sustain the brunt of war—was
prepared to set the example, without that foolish over-valuation
of favorable chances so ruinous even to first-rate powers, and
with full sense of the uncertainty of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_138">[p. 138]</span> future. Let them all feel that they
were neighbors, inhabitants of the same island, and called by the
common name of Sikeliots; and let them all with one accord repel the
intrusion of aliens in their affairs, whether as open assailants or
as treacherous mediators.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207"
class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>This harangue from Hermokratês, and the earnest dispositions
of Syracuse for peace, found general sympathy among the Sicilian
cities, Ionic as well as Doric. All of them doubtless suffered by
the war, and the Ionic cities, who had solicited the intervention
of the Athenians as protectors against Syracuse, conceived from the
evident uneasiness of the latter a fair assurance of her pacific
demeanor for the future. Accordingly, the peace was accepted by all
the belligerent parties, each retaining what they possessed, except
that the Syracusans agreed to cede Morgantinê to Kamarina, on receipt
of a fixed sum of money.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208"
class="fnanchor">[208]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[p.
139]</span> The Ionic cities stipulated that Athens should be
included in the pacification; a condition agreed to by all, except
the Epizephyrian Lokrians.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209"
class="fnanchor">[209]</a> They then acquainted Eurymedon and
his colleagues with the terms; inviting them to accede to the
pacification in the name of Athens, and then to withdraw their fleet
from Sicily. Nor had these generals any choice but to close with the
proposition. Athens thus was placed on terms of peace with all the
Sicilian cities, with liberty of access reciprocally to any single
ship of war, but no armed force to cross the sea between Sicily
and Peloponnesus. Eurymedon then sailed with his fleet home.<a
id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>On reaching Athens, however, he and his colleagues were received
by the people with much displeasure. He himself was fined, and his
colleagues Sophoklês and Pythodôrus banished, on the charge of having
been bribed to quit Sicily, at a time when the fleet—so the Athenians
believed—was strong enough to have made important conquests. Why the
three colleagues were differently treated we are not informed.<a
id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
This sentence was harsh and unmerited; for it does not seem that
Eurymedon had it in his power to prevent the Ionic cities from
concluding peace, while it is certain that without them he could have
achieved nothing serious. All that seems unexplained in his conduct,
as recounted by Thucydidês, is, that his arrival at Rhegium with the
entire fleet in September, 425 <small>B.C.</small>, does
not seem to have been attended with any increased vigor or success,
in the prosecution of the war. But the Athenians—besides an undue
depreciation of the Sicilian cities, which we shall find fatally
misleading them hereafter—were at this moment at the maximum of
extravagant hopes, counting upon new triumphs everywhere, impatient
of disappointment, and careless of proportion between the means
intrusted to, and the objects expected from, their commanders.
Such unmeasured confidence was painfully corrected in the course
of a few months, by the battle of Delium<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_140">[p. 140]</span> and the losses in Thrace. But at the
present moment, it was probably not less astonishing than grievous to
the three generals, who had all left Athens prior to the success in
Sphakteria.</p>

<p>The Ionic cities in Sicily were soon made to feel that they
had been premature in sending away the Athenians. Dispute between
Leontini and Syracuse, the same cause which had occasioned the
invocation of Athens three years before, broke out afresh soon
after the pacification of Gela. The democratical government of
Leontini came to the resolution of strengthening their city by the
enrolment of many new citizens; and a redivision of the territorial
property of the state was projected in order to provide lots of land
for these new-comers. But the aristocracy of the town upon whom
the necessity would thus be imposed of parting with a portion of
their lands, forestalled the project, seemingly before it was even
formally decided, by entering into a treasonable correspondence with
Syracuse, bringing in a Syracusan army, and expelling the Demos.<a
id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
While these exiles found shelter as<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_141">[p. 141]</span> they could in other cities, the rich
Leontines deserted and dismantled their own city, transferred their
residence to Syracuse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[p.
142]</span> and were enrolled as Syracusan citizens. To them the
operation was exceedingly profitable, since they became masters
of the properties of the exiled Demos in addition to their own.
Presently, however, some of them, dissatisfied with their residence
in Syracuse, returned to the abandoned city, and fitted up a portion
of it called Phokeis, together with a neighboring strong post called
Brikinnies. Here, after being joined by a considerable number of the
exiled Demos, they contrived to hold out for some time against the
efforts of the Syracusans to expel them from their fortifications.</p>

<p>The new enrolment of citizens, projected by the Leontine
democracy, seems to date during the year succeeding the pacification
of Gela, and was probably intended to place the city in a more
defensible position in case of renewed attacks from Syracuse, thus
compensating for the departure of the Athenian auxiliaries. The
Leontine Demos, in exile and suffering, doubtless bitterly repenting
that they had concurred in dismissing these auxiliaries, sent
envoys to Athens with complaints, and renewed prayers for help.<a
id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>But Athens was then too much pressed to attend to their call;
her defeat at Delium and her losses in Thrace had been followed
by the truce for one year; and even during that truce, she had
been called upon for strenuous efforts in Thrace to check the
progress of Brasidas. After the expiration of that truce, she
sent Phæax and two colleagues to Sicily (<small>B.C.</small> 422)
with the modest force of two triremes. He was directed to try and
organize an anti-Syracusan party in the island, for the purpose of
reëstablishing the Leontine Demos. In passing along the coast of
Italy, he concluded amicable relations with some of the Grecian
cities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[p. 143]</span>
especially with Lokri, which had hitherto stood aloof from Athens;
and his first addresses in Sicily appeared to promise success.
His representations of danger from Syracusan ambition were well
received both at Kamarina and Agrigentum. For on the one hand, that
universal terror of Athens, which had dictated the pacification of
Gela, had now disappeared; while on the other hand, the proceeding
of Syracuse in regard to Leontini was well calculated to excite
alarm. We see by that proceeding that sympathy between democracies
in different towns was not universal: the Syracusan democracy had
joined with the Leontine aristocracy to expel the Demos, just as
the despot Gelon had combined with the aristocracy of Megara and
Eubœa, sixty years before, and had sold the Demos of those towns
into slavery. The birthplace of the famous rhetor Gorgias was struck
out of the list of inhabited cities; its temples were deserted;
and its territory had become a part of Syracuse. All these were
circumstances so powerfully affecting Grecian imagination, that
the Kamarinæans, neighbors of Syracuse on the other side, might
well fear lest the like unjust conquest, expulsion, and absorption,
should soon overtake them. Agrigentum, though without any similar
fear, was disposed from policy, and jealousy of Syracuse, to second
the views of Phæax. But when the latter proceeded to Gela, in order
to procure the adhesion of that city in addition to the other two,
he found himself met by so resolute an opposition that his whole
scheme was frustrated, nor did he think it advisable even to open
his case at Selinus or Himera. In returning, he crossed the interior
of the island through the territory of the Sikels to Katana, passing
in his way by Brikinnies, where the Leontine Demos were still
maintaining a precarious existence. Having encouraged them to hold
out by assurances of aid, he proceeded on his homeward voyage. In
the strait of Messina, he struck upon some vessels conveying a body
of expelled Lokrians from Messênê to Lokri. The Lokrians had got
possession of Messênê after the pacification of Gela, by means of
an internal sedition; but after holding it some time, they were now
driven out by a second revolution. Phæax, being under agreement
with Lokri, passed by these vessels without any act of hostility.<a
id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[p. 144]</span></p> <p>The
Leontine exiles at Brikinnies, however, received no benefit from
his assurances, and appear soon afterwards to have been completely
expelled. Nevertheless, Athens was noway disposed, for a considerable
time, to operations in Sicily. A few months after the visit of
Phæax to that island, came the Peace of Nikias: the consequences
of that peace occupied her whole attention in Peloponnesus, while
the ambition of Alkibiadês carried her on for three years in
intra-Peloponnesian projects and coöperation with Argos against
Sparta. It was only in the year 417 <small>B.C.</small>, when these
projects had proved abortive, that she had leisure to turn her
attention elsewhere. During that year, Nikias had contemplated an
expedition against Amphipolis in conjunction with Perdikkas, whose
desertion frustrated the scheme. The year 416 <small>B.C.</small> was
that in which Mêlos was besieged and taken.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Syracusans had cleared and appropriated all the
territory of Leontini, which city now existed only in the talk and
hopes of its exiles. Of these latter a portion seem to have continued
at Athens, pressing their entreaties for aid, which began to obtain
some attention about the year 417 <small>B.C.</small>,
when another incident happened to strengthen their chance of success.
A quarrel broke out between the neighboring cities of Selinus
(Hellenic) and Egesta (non-Hellenic) in the western corner of Sicily;
partly about a piece of land on the river which divided the two
territories, partly about some alleged wrong in cases of internuptial
connection. The Selinuntines, not satisfied with their own strength,
obtained assistance from the Syracusans their allies, and thus
reduced Egesta to considerable straits by land as well as by sea.<a
id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Now
the Egestæans had allied themselves with Lachês ten years before,
during the first expedition sent by the Athenians to Sicily; upon
the strength of which alliance they sent to Athens, to solicit her
intervention for their defence, after having in vain applied both
to Agrigentum and to Carthage. It may seem singular that Carthage
did not at this time readily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[p.
145]</span> embrace the pretext for interference, considering that,
ten years afterwards, she interfered with such destructive effect
against Selinus. At this time, however, the fear of Athens and
her formidable navy appears to have been felt even at Carthage,<a
id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
thus protecting the Sicilian Greeks against the most dangerous of
their neighbors.</p>

<p>The Egestæan envoys reached Athens in the spring of 416
<small>B.C.</small>, at a time when the Athenians had no immediate
project to occupy their thoughts, except the enterprise against
Mêlos, which could not be either long or doubtful. Though urgent
in setting forth the necessities of their position, they at the
same time did not appear, like the Leontines, as mere helpless
suppliants, addressing themselves to Athenian compassion. They rested
their appeal chiefly on grounds of policy. The Syracusans, having
already extinguished one ally of Athens (Leontini), were now hard
pressing upon a second (Egesta), and would thus successively subdue
them all: as soon as this was completed, there would be nothing
left in Sicily except an omnipotent Dorian combination, allied to
Peloponnesus both by race and descent, and sure to lend effective
aid in putting down Athens herself. It was therefore essential for
Athens to forestall this coming danger by interfering forthwith to
uphold her remaining allies against the encroachments of Syracuse.
If she would send a naval expedition adequate to the rescue of
Egesta, the Egestæans themselves engaged to provide ample funds for
the prosecution of the war.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217"
class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Such representations from the envoys, and fears of Syracusan
aggrandizement as a source of strength to Peloponnesus, worked
along with the prayers of the Leontines in rekindling the appetite
of Athens for extending her power in Sicily. The impression made
upon the Athenian public, favorable from the first, was wound up
to a still higher pitch by renewed discussion. The envoys were
repeatedly heard in the public assembly,<a id="FNanchor_218"
href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> together<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[p. 146]</span> with those citizens who
supported their propositions. At the head of these was Alkibiadês,
who aspired to the command of the intended expedition, tempting alike
to his love of glory, of adventure, and of personal gain. But it is
plain from these renewed discussions that at first the disposition of
the people was by no means decided, much less unanimous, and that a
considerable party sustained Nikias in a prudential opposition. Even
at last, the resolution adopted was not one of positive consent, but
a mean term such as perhaps Nikias himself could not resist. Special
envoys were despatched to Egesta, partly to ascertain the means of
the town to fulfil its assurance of defraying the costs of war,
partly to make investigations on the spot and report upon the general
state of affairs.</p>

<p>Perhaps the commissioners despatched were men themselves
friendly to the enterprise; nor is it impossible that some of them
may have been individually bribed by the Egestæans; at least such
a supposition is not forbidden by the average state of Athenian
public morality. But the most honest or even suspicious men could
hardly be prepared for the deep-laid stratagems put in practice
to delude them, on their arrival at Egesta. They were conducted
to the rich temple of Aphroditê on Mount Eryx, where the plate
and donatives were exhibited before them; abundant in number, and
striking to the eye, yet composed mostly of silver-gilt vessels,
which, though falsely passed off as solid gold, were in reality
of little pecuniary value. Moreover, the Egestæan citizens were
profuse in their hospitalities and entertainments both to the
commissioners and to the crews of the triremes.<a id="FNanchor_219"
href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> They collected
together all the gold and silver vessels, dishes, and goblets,
of Egesta, which they farther enlarged by borrowing additional
ornaments of the same kind from the neighboring cities, Hellenic
as well as Carthaginian. At each successive<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_147">[p. 147]</span> entertainment, every Egestæan host
exhibited all this large stock of plate as his own property, the
same stock being transferred from house to house for the occasion.
A false appearance was thus created, of the large number of wealthy
men in Egesta; and the Athenian seamen, while their hearts were
won by the caresses, saw with amazement this prodigious display
of gold and silver, and were thoroughly duped by the fraud.<a
id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> To
complete the illusion, by resting it on a basis of reality and prompt
payment, sixty talents of uncoined silver were at once produced
as ready for the operations of war. With this sum in hand, the
Athenian commissioners, after finishing their examination, and the
Egestæan envoys also, returned to Athens, which they reached in the
spring of 415 <small>B.C.</small>,<a id="FNanchor_221"
href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> about three months
after the capture of Mêlos.</p>

<p>The Athenian assembly being presently convened to hear their
report, the deluded commissioners drew a magnificent picture of
the wealth, public and private, which they had actually seen and
touched at Egesta, and presented the sixty talents—one month’s
pay for a fleet of sixty triremes—as a small instalment out of
the vast stock remaining behind. While they thus officially
certified the capacity of the Egestæans to perform their promise
of defraying the cost of the war, the seamen of their trireme,
addressing the assembly in their character of citizens,—beyond
all suspicion of being bribed,—overflowing with sympathy for the
town in which they had just been so cordially welcomed, and full
of wonder at the display of wealth which they had witnessed,
would probably contribute still more effectually to kindle the
sympathies of their countrymen. Accordingly, when the Eges<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[p. 148]</span>tæan envoys again
renewed their petitions and representations, confidently appealing
to the scrutiny which they had undergone,—when the distress of the
suppliant Leontines was again depicted,—the Athenian assembly no
longer delayed coming to a final decision. They determined to send
forthwith sixty triremes to Sicily, under three generals with full
powers,—Nikias, Alkibiadês, and Lamachus; for the purpose, first, of
relieving Egesta; next, as soon as that primary object should have
been accomplished, of reëstablishing the city of Leontini; lastly, of
furthering the views of Athens in Sicily, by any other means which
they might find practicable.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222"
class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Such resolution being passed, a fresh
assembly was appointed for the fifth day following, to settle the
details.</p>

<p>We cannot doubt that this assembly, in which the reports from
Egesta were first delivered, was one of unqualified triumph to
Alkibiadês and those who had from the first advocated the expedition,
as well as of embarrassment and humiliation to Nikias, who had
opposed it. He was probably more astonished than any one else at
the statements of the commissioners and seamen, because he did not
believe in the point which they went to establish. Yet he could
not venture to contradict eye-witnesses speaking in evident good
faith, and as the assembly went heartily along with them, he labored
under great difficulty in repeating his objections to a scheme now
so much strengthened in public favor. Accordingly, his speech was
probably hesitating and ineffective; the more so, as his opponents,
far from wishing to make good any personal triumph against himself,
were forward in proposing his name first on the list of generals,
in spite of his own declared repugnance.<a id="FNanchor_223"
href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> But when the
assembly broke up, he be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[p.
149]</span>came fearfully impressed with the perilous resolution
which it had adopted, and at the same time conscious that he had not
done justice to his own case against it. He therefore resolved to
avail himself of the next assembly, four days afterwards, for the
purpose of reopening the debate, and again denouncing the intended
expedition. Properly speaking, the Athenians might have declined to
hear him on this subject; indeed, the question which he raised could
not be put without illegality: the principle of the measure had been
already determined, and it remained only to arrange the details, for
which special purpose the coming assembly had been appointed. But he
was heard, and with perfect patience; and his harangue, a valuable
sample, both of the man and of the time, is set forth at length by
Thucydidês. I give here the chief points of it, not confining myself
to the exact expressions.</p>

<p>“Though we are met to-day, Athenians, to settle the particulars
of the expedition already pronounced against Sicily, yet I think
we ought to take farther counsel whether it be well to send that
expedition at all; nor ought we thus hastily to plunge, at the
instance of aliens, into a dangerous war noway belonging to us. To
myself personally, indeed, your resolution has offered an honorable
appointment, and for my own bodily danger I care as little as any
man: yet no considerations of personal dignity have ever before
prevented me, nor shall now prevent me, from giving you my honest
opinion, however it may clash with your habitual judgments. I tell
you, then, that in your desire to go to Sicily, you leave many
enemies here behind you, and that you will bring upon yourselves
new enemies from thence to help them. Perhaps you fancy that your
truce with Sparta is an adequate protection. In name, indeed
(though only in name, thanks to the intrigues of parties both here
and there), that truce may stand, so long as your power remains
unimpaired; but on your first serious reverses, the enemy will
eagerly take the opportunity of assailing you. Some of your most
powerful enemies have never even accepted the truce; and if you
divide your force as you now propose, they will probably set upon
you at once along with the Sicilians, whom they would have been
too happy to procure as coöperating allies at the beginning of the
war. Recollect that your Chalkidian subjects in Thrace are still in
revolt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[p. 150]</span> and have
never yet been conquered: other continental subjects, too, are not
much to be trusted; and you are going to redress injuries offered
to Egesta, before you have yet thought of redressing your own. Now
your conquests in Thrace, if you make any, can be maintained; but
Sicily is so distant, and the people so powerful, that you will
never be able to maintain permanent ascendency; and it is absurd
to undertake an expedition wherein conquest cannot be permanent,
while failure will be destructive. The Egestæans alarm you by the
prospect of Syracusan aggrandizement. But to me it seems that the
Sicilian Greeks, even if they become subjects of Syracuse, will be
less dangerous to you than they are at present: for as matters stand
now, they might possibly send aid to Peloponnesus, from desire on the
part of each to gain the favor of Lacedæmon, but imperial Syracuse
would have no motive to endanger her own empire for the purpose of
putting down yours. You are now full of confidence, because you have
come out of the war better than you at first feared. But do not trust
the Spartans: they, the most sensitive of all men to the reputation
of superiority, are lying in wait to play you a trick in order to
repair their own dishonor: their oligarchical machinations against
you demand all your vigilance, and leave you no leisure to think of
these foreigners at Egesta. Having just recovered ourselves somewhat
from the pressure of disease and war, we ought to reserve this
newly-acquired strength for our own purposes, instead of wasting it
upon the treacherous assurances of desperate exiles from Sicily.”</p>

<p>Nikias then continued, doubtless turning towards Alkibiadês:
“If any man, delighted to be named to the command, though still
too young for it, exhorts you to this expedition in his own
selfish interests, looking to admiration for his ostentation in
chariot-racing, and to profit from his command, as a means of making
good his extravagances, do not let such a man gain celebrity for
himself at the hazard of the entire city. Be persuaded that such
persons are alike unprincipled in regard to the public property and
wasteful as to their own, and that this matter is too serious for
the rash counsels of youth. I tremble when I see before me this
band sitting, by previous concert, close to their leader in the
assembly; and I in my turn exhort the elderly men, who are near them,
not to be shamed out of their opposition by<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_151">[p. 151]</span> the fear of being called cowards. Let
them leave to these men the ruinous appetite for what is not within
reach, in the conviction that few plans ever succeed from passionate
desire; many, from deliberate foresight. Let them vote against the
expedition; maintaining undisturbed our present relations with
the Sicilian cities, and desiring the Egestæans to close the war
against Selinus, as they have begun it, without the aid of Athens.<a
id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Nor
be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[p. 152]</span> thou afraid,
prytanis (Mr. President), to submit this momentous question again to
the decision of the assembly, seeing that breach of the law, in the
presence of so many witnesses, cannot expose thee to impeachment,
while thou wilt afford opportunity for the correction of a perilous
misjudgment.”</p>

<p>Such were the principal points in the speech of Nikias on this
memorable occasion. It was heard with attention, and probably made
some impression, since it completely reopened the entire debate, in
spite of the formal illegality. Immediately after he sat down, while
his words were yet fresh in the ears of the audience, Alkibiadês rose
to reply. The speech just made, bringing the expedition again into
question, endangered his dearest hopes both of fame and of pecuniary
acquisition; for his dreams went farther than those of any man in
Athens; not merely to the conquest of all Sicily, but also to that
of Carthage and the Carthaginian empire. Opposed to Nikias, both in
personal character and in political tendencies, he had pushed his
rivalry to such a degree of bitterness that at one moment a vote
of ostracism had been on the point of deciding between them. That
vote had indeed been turned aside by joint consent, and discharged
upon Hyperbolus; yet the hostile feeling still continued on both
sides, and Nikias had just manifested it by a parliamentary attack
of the most galling character; all the more galling because it was
strictly accurate and well deserved. Provoked as well as alarmed,
Alkibiadês started up forthwith, his impatience breaking loose from
the formalities of an exordium.</p>

<p>“Athenians, I both have better title than others to the post of
commander,—for the taunts of Nikias force me to begin here,—and I
count myself fully worthy of it. Those very matters with which he
reproaches me are sources not merely of glory to my ancestors and
myself, but of positive advantage to my country. For the Greeks, on
witnessing my splendid theôry at Olympia, were induced to rate the
power of Athens even above the reality, having before regarded it as
broken down by the war; when I sent into the lists seven chariots,
being more than any private individual had ever sent before, winning
the first prize, coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[p.
153]</span> in also second and fourth, and performing all the
accessories in a manner suitable to an Olympic victory. Custom
attaches honor to such exploits, but the power of the performers
is at the same time brought home to the feelings of spectators. My
exhibitions at Athens, too, choregic and others, are naturally viewed
with jealousy by my rivals here; but in the eyes of strangers they
are evidences of power. Such so-called folly is by no means useless,
when a man at his own cost serves the city as well as himself. Nor
is it unjust, when a man has an exalted opinion of himself, that
he should not conduct himself towards others as if he were their
equal; for the man in misfortune finds no one to bear a share of
it. Just as, when we are in distress, we find no one to speak to
us, in like manner let a man lay his account to bear the insolence
of the prosperous, or else let him give equal dealing to the low,
and then claim to receive it from the high. I know well that such
exalted personages, and all who have in any way attained eminence,
have been during their lifetime unpopular, chiefly in society with
their equals, and to a certain extent with others also; while after
their decease, they have left such a reputation as to make people
claim kindred with them falsely, and to induce their country to boast
of them, not as though they were aliens or wrongdoers, but as her
own citizens and as men who did her honor. It is this glory which
I desire, and in pursuit of which I incur such reproaches for my
private conduct. Yet look at my public conduct, and see whether it
will not bear comparison with that of any other citizen. I brought
together the most powerful states in Peloponnesus without any serious
cost or hazard to you, and made the Lacedæmonians peril their all at
Mantineia on the fortune of one day: a peril so great, that, though
victorious, they have not even yet regained their steady belief in
their own strength.”</p>

<p>“Thus did my youth, and my so-called monstrous folly, find
suitable words to address the Peloponnesian powers, and earnestness
to give them confidence and obtain their coöperation. Be not now,
therefore, afraid of this youth of mine: but so long an I possess it
in full vigor, and so long as Nikias retains his reputation for good
fortune, turn us each to account in our own way.”<a id="FNanchor_225"
href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[p. 154]</span></p> <p>Having thus
vindicated himself personally, Alkibiadês went on to deprecate
any change of the public resolution already taken. The Sicilian
cities, he said, were not so formidable as was represented. Their
population was numerous, indeed, but fluctuating, turbulent, often
on the move, and without local attachment. No man there considered
himself as a permanent resident, nor cared to defend the city in
which he dwelt; nor were there arms or organization for such a
purpose. The native Sikels, detesting Syracuse, would willingly lend
their aid to her assailants. As to the Peloponnesians, powerful
as they were, they were not more desperate enemies now than they
had been in former days:<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226"
class="fnanchor">[226]</a> they might invade Attica by land whether
the Athenians sailed to Sicily or not; but they could do no mischief
by sea, for Athens would still have in reserve a navy sufficient
to restrain them. What valid ground was there, therefore, to evade
performing obligations which Athens had sworn to her Sicilian allies?
To be sure, <i>they</i> could bring no help to Attica in return; but
Athens did not want them on her own side of the water; she wanted
them in Sicily, to prevent her Sicilian enemies from coming over to
attack her. She had originally acquired her empire by a readiness
to interfere wherever she was invited; nor would she have made any
progress, if she had been backward or prudish in scrutinizing such
invitations. She could not now set limits to the extent of her
imperial sway; she was under a necessity not merely to retain her
present subjects, but to lay snares for new subjects, on pain of
falling into dependence herself if she ceased to be imperial. Let
her then persist in the resolution adopted, and strike terror into
the Peloponnesians by undertaking this great expedition. She would
probably conquer all Sicily; at least she would humble Syracuse: in
case even of failure, she could always bring back her troops, from
her unquestionable superiority at sea. The stationary and inactive
policy recommended by Nikias<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[p.
155]</span> was not less at variance with the temper, than with
the position, of Athens, and would be ruinous to her if pursued.
Her military organization would decline, and her energies would
be wasted in internal rub and conflict, instead of that steady
activity and acquisition which had become engrafted upon her laws
and habits, which could not be now renounced, even if bad in itself,
without speedy destruction.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227"
class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>Such was substantially the reply of Alkibiadês to Nikias. The
debate was now completely reopened, so that several speakers
addressed the assembly on both sides; more, however, decidedly in
favor of the expedition than against it. The alarmed Egestæans and
Leontines renewed their supplications, appealing to the plighted
faith of the city: probably also those Athenians who had visited
Egesta, again stood forward to protest against what they would call
the ungenerous doubts and insinuations of Nikias. By all these
appeals, after considerable debate, the assembly was so powerfully
moved, that their determination to send the fleet became more intense
than ever; and Nikias, perceiving that farther direct opposition was
useless, altered his tactics. He now attempted a manœuvre, designed
indirectly to disgust his countrymen with the plan, by enlarging upon
its dangers and difficulties, and insisting upon a prodigious force
as indispensable to surmount them. Nor was he without hopes that they
might be sufficiently disheartened by such prospective hardships,
to throw up the scheme altogether. At any rate, if they persisted,
he himself as commander would thus be enabled to execute it with
completeness and confidence.</p>

<p>Accepting the expedition, therefore, as the pronounced fiat
of the people, he reminded them that the cities which they were
about to attack, especially Syracuse and Selinus, were powerful,
populous, free: well prepared in every way with hoplites, horsemen,
light-armed troops, ships of war, plenty of horses to mount their
cavalry, and abundant corn at home. At best, Athens could hope for no
other allies in Sicily except Naxus and Katana, from their kindred
with the Leontines. It was no mere fleet, therefore, which could
cope with enemies like these on their own soil. The fleet indeed
must be prodigiously great, for the purpose<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_156">[p. 156]</span> not merely of maritime combat, but of
keeping open communication at sea, and insuring the importation of
subsistence. But there must besides be a large force of hoplites,
bowmen, and slingers, a large stock of provisions in transports,
and, above all an abundant amount of money: for the funds promised
by the Egestæans would be found mere empty delusion. The army
must be not simply a match for the enemy’s regular hoplites and
powerful cavalry, but also independent of foreign aid from the first
day of their landing.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228"
class="fnanchor">[228]</a> If not, in case of the least reverse, they
would find everywhere nothing but active enemies, without a single
friend. “I know (he concluded) that there are many dangers against
which we must take precaution, and many more in which we must trust
to good fortune, serious as it is for mere men to do so. But I choose
to leave as little as possible in the power of fortune, and to have
in hand all means of reasonable security at the time when I leave
Athens. Looking merely to the interests of the commonwealth, this is
the most assured course; while to us who are to form the armament, it
is indispensable for preservation. If any man thinks differently, I
resign to him the command.”<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229"
class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>The effect of this second speech of Nikias on the assembly,
coming as it did after a long and contentious debate, was much
greater than that which had been produced by his first. But it was
an effect totally opposite to that which he himself had anticipated
and intended. Far from being discouraged or alienated from the
expedition by those impediments which he had studiously magnified,
the people only attached themselves to it with yet greater obstinacy.
The difficulties which stood in the way of Sicilian conquest served
but to endear it to them the more, calling forth increased ardor and
eagerness for personal exertion in the cause. The people not only
accepted, without hesitation or deduction, the estimate which Nikias
had laid before them of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[p.
157]</span> risk and cost, but warmly extolled his frankness
not less than his sagacity, as the only means of making success
certain. They were ready to grant without reserve everything which
he asked, with an enthusiasm and unanimity such as was rarely seen
to reign in an Athenian assembly. In fact, the second speech of
Nikias had brought the two dissentient veins of the assembly into
a confluence and harmony, all the more welcome because unexpected.
While his partisans seconded it as the best way of neutralizing the
popular madness, his opponents—Alkibiadês, the Egestæans, and the
Leontines—caught at it with acclamation, as realizing more than
they had hoped for, and more than they could ever have ventured to
propose. If Alkibiadês had demanded an armament on so vast a scale,
the people would have turned a deaf ear. But such was their respect
for Nikias—on the united grounds of prudence, good fortune, piety,
and favor with the gods—that his opposition to their favorite scheme
had really made them uneasy; and when he made the same demand, they
were delighted to purchase his concurrence by adopting all such
conditions as he imposed.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230"
class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>It was thus that Nikias, quite contrary to his own purpose, not
only imparted to the enterprise a gigantic magnitude which its
projectors had never contemplated, but threw into it the whole
soul of Athens, and roused a burst of ardor beyond all former
example. Every man present, old as well as young, rich and poor,
of all classes and professions, was eager to put down his name for
personal service. Some were tempted by the love of gain, others
by the curiosity of seeing so distant a region, others again by
the pride and supposed safety of enlisting in so irresistible an
armament. So overpowering was the popular voice in calling for
the execution of the scheme, that the small minority who retained
their objections were afraid to hold up their hands, for fear of
incurring the suspicion of want of patriotism. When the excitement
had somewhat subsided, an orator named Demostratus, coming forward
as spokesman of this sentiment, urged Nikias to declare at once,
without farther evasion, what force he required from the people.
Disappointed as Nikias was, yet being left without any alternative,
he sadly responded to the appeal; saying, that he would take farther
counsel with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[p. 158]</span> his
colleagues, but that speaking on his first impression, he thought
the triremes required must be not less than one hundred, nor the
hoplites less than five thousand, Athenians and allies together.
There must farther be a proportional equipment of other forces and
accompaniments, especially Kretan bowmen and slingers. Enormous as
this requisition was, the vote of the people not only sanctioned
it without delay, but even went beyond it. They conferred upon the
generals full power to fix both the numbers of the armament and every
other matter relating to the expedition, just as they might think
best for the interest of Athens.</p>

<p>Pursuant to this momentous resolution, the enrolment and
preparation of the forces was immediately begun. Messages were
sent to summon sufficient triremes from the nautical allies, as
well as to invite hoplites from Argos and Mantineia, and to hire
bowmen and slingers elsewhere. For three months, the generals were
busily engaged in this proceeding, while the city was in a state of
alertness and bustle, fatally interrupted, however, by an incident
which I shall recount in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Considering the prodigious consequences which turned on the
expedition of Athens against Sicily, it is worth while to bestow
a few reflections on the preliminary proceedings of the Athenian
people. Those who are accustomed to impute all the misfortunes of
Athens to the hurry, passion, and ignorance of democracy, will not
find the charge borne out by the facts which we have been just
considering. The supplications of Egestæans and Leontines, forwarded
to Athens about the spring or summer of 416 <small>B.C.</small>,
undergo careful and repeated discussion in the public assembly. They
at first meet with considerable opposition, but the repeated debates
gradually kindle both the sympathies and the ambition of the people.
Still, however, no decisive step is taken without more ample and
correct information from the spot, and special commissioners are sent
to Egesta for the purpose. These men bring back a decisive report,
triumphantly certifying all that the Egestæans had promised: nor can
we at all wonder that the people never suspected the deep-laid fraud
whereby their commissioners had been duped.</p>

<p>Upon the result of that mission to Egesta, the two parties for
and against the projected expedition had evidently joined issue;
and when the commissioners returned, bearing testimony so de<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[p. 159]</span>cisive in favor of the
former, the party thus strengthened thought itself warranted in
calling for a decision immediately, after all the previous debates.
Nevertheless, the measure still had to surmount the renewed and
hearty opposition of Nikias, before it became finally ratified. It
was this long and frequent debate, with opposition often repeated
but always outreasoned, which working gradually deeper and deeper
conviction in the minds of the people, brought them all into hearty
unanimity to support it, and made them cling to it with that tenacity
which the coming chapters will demonstrate. In so far as the
expedition was an error, it certainly was not error arising either
from hurry, or want of discussion, or want of inquiry. Never in
Grecian history was any measure more carefully weighed beforehand, or
more deliberately and unanimously resolved.</p>

<p>The position of Nikias in reference to the measure is remarkable.
As a dissuasive and warning counsellor, he took a right view of
it; but in that capacity he could not carry the people along with
him. Yet such was their steady esteem for him personally, and their
reluctance to proceed in the enterprise without him, that they
eagerly embraced any conditions which he thought proper to impose.
And the conditions which he named had the effect of exaggerating the
enterprise into such gigantic magnitude as no one in Athens had ever
contemplated; thus casting into it so prodigious a proportion of the
blood of Athens, that its discomfiture would be equivalent to the
ruin of the commonwealth. This was the first mischief occasioned by
Nikias, when, after being forced to relinquish his direct opposition,
he resorted to the indirect manœuvre of demanding more than he
thought the people would be willing to grant. It will be found only
the first among a sad series of other mistakes, fatal to his country
as well as to himself.</p>

<p>Giving to Nikias, however, for the present, full credit for
the wisdom of his dissuasive counsel and his skepticism about the
reports from Egesta, we cannot but notice the opposite quality in
Alkibiadês. His speech is not merely full of overweening insolence,
as a manifestation of individual character, but of rash and ruinous
instigations in regard to the foreign policy of his country. The
arguments whereby he enforces the expedition against Syracuse
are indeed more mischievous in their tendency than the ex<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[p. 160]</span>pedition itself, for
the failure of which Alkibiades is not to be held responsible. It
might have succeeded in its special object, had it been properly
conducted; but even if it had succeeded, the remark of Nikias is not
the less just, that Athens was aiming at an unmeasured breadth of
empire, which it would be altogether impossible for her to preserve.
When we recollect the true political wisdom with which Periklês had
advised his countrymen to maintain strenuously their existing empire,
but by no means to grasp at any new acquisitions while they had
powerful enemies in Peloponnesus, we shall appreciate by contrast the
feverish system of never-ending aggression inculcated by Alkibiadês,
and the destructive principles which he lays down, that Athens
must forever be engaged in new conquests, on pain of forfeiting
her existing empire and tearing herself to pieces by internal
discord. Even granting the necessity for Athens to employ her
military and naval force, as Nikias had truly observed, Amphipolis
and the revolted subjects in Thrace were still unsubdued; and the
first employment of Athenian force ought to be directed against
them, instead of being wasted in distant hazards and treacherous
novelties, creating for Athens a position in which she could never
permanently maintain herself. The parallel which Alkibiadês draws,
between the enterprising spirit whereby the Athenian empire had
been first acquired, and the undefined speculations which he was
himself recommending, is altogether fallacious. The Athenian empire
took its rise from Athenian enterprise, working in concert with a
serious alarm and necessity on the part of all the Grecian cities
in or round the Ægean sea. Athens rendered an essential service
by keeping off the Persians, and preserving that sea in a better
condition than it had ever been in before: her empire had begun
by being a voluntary confederacy, and had only passed by degrees
into constraint; while the local situation of all her subjects was
sufficiently near to be within the reach of her controlling navy.
Her new career of aggression in Sicily, was in all these respects
different. Nor is it less surprising to find Alkibiadês asserting
that the multiplication of subjects in that distant island, employing
a large portion of the Athenian naval force to watch them, would
impart new stability to the preëxisting Athenian empire; to read
the terms in which he makes light of enemies both in Peloponnesus
and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[p. 161]</span>
Sicily, the Sicilian war being a new enterprise hardly less in
magnitude and hazard than the Peloponnesian,<a id="FNanchor_231"
href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> and to notice the
credit which he claims to himself for his operations in Peloponnesus
and the battle of Mantineia,<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232"
class="fnanchor">[232]</a> although it had ended in complete failure;
restoring the ascendency of Sparta to the maximum at which it had
stood before the events of Sphakteria! There is in fact no speech in
Thucydidês so replete with rash misguiding, and fallacious counsels,
as this harangue of Alkibiadês.</p>

<p>As a man of action, Alkibiadês was always brave, vigorous, and
full of resource; as a politician and adviser, he was especially
mischievous to his country, because he addressed himself exactly to
their weak point, and exaggerated their sanguine and enterprising
temper into a temerity which overlooked all permanent calculation.
The Athenians had now contracted the belief that they, as lords of
the sea, were entitled to dominion and receipt of tribute from all
islands; a belief which they had not only acted upon, but openly
professed, in their attack upon Mêlos during the preceding autumn.
As Sicily was an island, it seemed to fall naturally under this
category of subjects; nor ought we to wonder, amidst the inaccurate
geographical data current in that day, that they were ignorant how
much larger Sicily was<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233"
class="fnanchor">[233]</a> than the largest island in the Ægean.
Yet they seem to have been aware that it was a prodigious conquest
to struggle for; as we may judge from the fact, that the object was
one kept back rather than openly avowed, and that they acceded to
all the immense preparations demanded by Nikias.<a id="FNanchor_234"
href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Moreover, we shall
see presently, that even the armament which was despatched had
conceived nothing beyond vague and hesitating ideas of something
great to be achieved in Sicily. But if the Athenian public<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[p. 162]</span> were rash and ignorant,
in contemplating the conquest of Sicily, much more extravagant
were the views of Alkibiadês, who looked even beyond Sicily to the
conquest of Carthage and her empire. Nor was it merely ambition which
he desired to gratify; he was not less eager for the immense private
gains which would be consequent upon success, in order to supply
those deficiencies which his profligate expenditure had occasioned.<a
id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>When we recollect how loudly the charges have been preferred
against Kleon, of presumption, of rash policy, and of selfish motive,
in reference to Sphakteria, to the prosecution of the war generally,
and to Amphipolis; and when we compare these proceedings with the
conduct of Alkibiadês as here described, we shall see how much more
forcibly such charges attach to the latter than the former. It will
be seen before this volume is finished, that the vices of Alkibiadês,
and the defects of Nikias, were the cause of far greater ruin to
Athens than either Kleon or Hyperbolus, even if we regard the two

  FROM THE RESOLUTION OF THE ATHENIANS TO ATTACK SYRACUSE, DOWN TO
  THE FIRST WINTER AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL IN SICILY.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">For</span>
the two or three months immediately succeeding the final resolution
taken by the Athenians to invade Sicily, described in the last
chapter, the whole city was elate and bustling with preparation. I
have already mentioned that this resolution, though long opposed by
Nikias with a considerable minority, had at last been adopted—chiefly
through the unforeseen working of that which he intended as a
counter-manœuvre—with a degree of enthusiasm and unanimity, and upon
an enlarged scale, which surpassed all the anticipations of its
promoters. The prophets, circulators of oracles, and other accredited
religious advisers, announced generally the favorable dispositions
of the gods, and promised a triumphant result.<a id="FNanchor_236"
href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> All classes in the
city, rich and poor,—cultivators, traders, and seamen, old and young,
all embraced the project with ardor; as requiring a great effort, yet
promising unparalleled results, both of public aggrandizement and
individual gain. Each man was anxious to put down his own name for
personal service; so that the three generals, Nikias, Alkibiadês, and
Lamachus, when they proceeded to make their selection of hoplites,
instead of being forced to employ constraint and incur ill-will,
as happened when an expedition was unpopular, had only to choose
the fittest among a throng of eager volunteers. Every man provided
himself with his best arms and with bodily accoutrements, useful as
well as ostentatious, for a long voyage and for the exigencies of a
varied land-and-sea-service. Among the trierarchs, or rich citizens,
who undertook each in his turn the duty of commanding a ship of
war, the competition was yet stronger. Each of them accounted it an
honor to be named, and vied with his comrades to exhibit his ship
in the most finished state of equipment. The state, indeed,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[p. 164]</span> furnished both the
trireme with its essential tackle and oars, and the regular pay for
the crew; but the trierarch, even in ordinary cases, usually incurred
various expenses besides, to make the equipment complete and to
keep the crew together. Such additional outlay, neither exacted nor
defined by law, but only by custom and general opinion, was different
in every individual case, according to temper and circumstances.
But on the present occasion, zeal and forwardness were universal:
each trierarch tried to procure for his own ship the best crew, by
offers of additional reward to all, but especially to the thranitæ
or rowers on the highest of the three tiers:<a id="FNanchor_237"
href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> and it seems that the
seamen were not appointed specially to one ship, but were at liberty
to accept these offers, and to serve in any ship they preferred. Each
trierarch spent more than had ever been known before in pay, outfit,
provision, and even external decoration of his vessel. Besides the
best crews which Athens herself could furnish, picked seamen were
also required from subject-allies, and were bid for in the same
way by the trierarchs.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238"
class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>Such efforts were much facilitated by the fact, that five years
had now elapsed since the Peace of Nikias, without any considerable
warlike operations. While the treasury had become replenished with
fresh accumulations,<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239"
class="fnanchor">[239]</a> and the triremes increased<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[p. 165]</span> in number, the military
population, reinforced by additional numbers of youth, had forgotten
both the hardships of the war and the pressure of epidemic disease.
Hence the fleet now got together, while it surpassed in number all
previous armaments of Athens, except a single one in the second
year of the previous war under Periklês, was incomparably superior
even to that, and still more superior to all the rest, in the other
ingredients of force, material as well as moral; in picked men,
universal ardor, ships as well as arms in the best condition, and
accessories of every kind in abundance. Such was the confidence of
success, that many Athenians went prepared for trade as well as for
combat; so that the private stock thus added to the public outfit,
and to the sums placed in the hands of the generals, constituted an
unparalleled aggregate of wealth. Much of this was visible to the
eye, contributing to heighten that general excitement of Athenian
imagination which pervaded the whole city while the preparations
were going forward: a mingled feeling of private sympathy and
patriotism,—a dash of uneasiness from reflection on the distant and
unknown region wherein the fleet was to act,—yet an elate confidence
in Athenian force, such as had never before been entertained.<a
id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
We hear of Sokratês the philosopher,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_166">[p. 166]</span> and Meton the astronomer, as forming
exceptions to this universal tone of sanguine anticipation: the
familiar genius which constantly waited upon the philosopher is
supposed to have forewarned him of the result. Nor is it impossible
that he may have been averse to the expedition, though the fact
is less fully certified than we could wish. Amidst a general
predominance of the various favorable religious signs and prophecies,
there were also some unfavorable. Usually, on all public matters of
risk or gravity, there were prophets who gave assurances in opposite
ways: those which turned out right were treasured up: the rest were
at once forgotten, or never long remembered.<a id="FNanchor_241"
href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>After between two and three months of active preparations, the
expedition was almost ready to start, when an event happened which
fatally poisoned the prevalent cheerfulness of the city. This was the
mutilation of the Hermæ, one of the most extraordinary events in all
Grecian history.</p>

<p>These Hermæ, or half-statues of the god Hermês, were blocks of
marble about the height of the human figure. The upper part was
cut into a head, face, neck, and bust; the lower part was left as
a quadrangular pillar, broad at the base, without arms, body, or
legs, but with the significant mark of the male sex in front. They
were distributed in great numbers throughout Athens, and always in
the most conspicuous situations; standing beside the outer doors
of private houses as well as of temples, near the most frequented
porticos, at the intersection of cross ways, in the public agora.
They were thus present to the eye of every Athenian in all his
acts of intercommunion, either for business or pleasure, with his
fellow-citizens. The religious feelings of the Greeks considered
the god to be planted or domiciliated where his statue stood,<a
id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
so that the companionship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[p.
167]</span> sympathy, and guardianship of Hermês became
associated with most of the manifestations of conjunct life at
Athens,—political, social, commercial, or gymnastic. Moreover, the
quadrangular fashion of these statues, employed occasionally for
other gods besides Hermês, was a most ancient relic handed down from
the primitive rudeness of Pelasgian workmanship and was popular in
Arcadia as well as peculiarly frequent in Athens.<a id="FNanchor_243"
href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>About the end of May, 415 <small>B.C.</small>, in the
course of one and the same night, all these Hermæ, one of the most
peculiar marks of the city, were mutilated by unknown hands. Their
characteristic features were knocked off or levelled, so that nothing
was left except a mass of stone with no resemblance to humanity or
deity. All were thus dealt with in the same way, save and except
very few: nay, Andokidês affirms, and I incline to believe him, that
there was but <i>one</i> which escaped unharmed.<a id="FNanchor_244"
href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>It is of course impossible for any one to sympathize fully with
the feelings of a religion not his own: indeed, the sentiment
with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[p. 168]</span> which,
in the case of persons of different creeds, each regards the
strong emotions growing out of causes peculiar to the other, is
usually one of surprise that such trifles and absurdities can
occasion any serious distress or excitement.<a id="FNanchor_245"
href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> But if we take
that reasonable pains, which is incumbent on those who study the
history of Greece, to realize in our minds the religious and
political associations of the Athenians,<a id="FNanchor_246"
href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> noted in ancient
times for their superior piety, as well as for their accuracy and
magnificence about the visible monuments embodying that feeling,—we
shall in part comprehend the intensity of mingled dismay, terror,
and wrath, which beset the public mind on the morning after this
nocturnal sacrilege, alike unforeseen and unparalleled. Amidst all
the ruin and impoverishment which had been inflicted by the Persian
invasion of Attica, there was nothing which was so profoundly felt
or so long remembered as the deliberate burning of the statues
and temples of the gods.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247"
class="fnanchor">[247]</a> If we could imagine<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_169">[p. 169]</span> the excitement of a Spanish or Italian
town, on finding that all the images of the Virgin had been defaced
during the same night, we should have a parallel, though a very
inadequate parallel, to what was now felt at Athens, where religious
associations and persons were far more intimately allied with all
civil acts and with all the proceedings of every-day life; where,
too, the god and his efficiency were more forcibly localized, as well
as identified with the presence and keeping of the statue. To the
Athenians, when they went forth on the following morning, each man
seeing the divine guardian at his doorway dishonored and defaced, and
each man gradually coming to know that the devastation was general,
it would seem that the town had become as it were godless; that the
streets, the market-place, the porticos, were robbed of their divine
protectors; and what was worse still, that these protectors, having
been grossly insulted, carried away with them alienated sentiments,
wrathful and vindictive instead of tutelary and sympathizing. It was
on the protection of the gods, that all their political constitution
as well as the blessings of civil life depended; insomuch that the
curses of the gods were habitually invoked as sanction and punishment
for grave offences, political as well as others:<a id="FNanchor_248"
href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> an extension and
generalization of the feeling still attached to the judicial oath.
This was, in the minds of the people of Athens, a sincere and literal
conviction, not simply a form of speech to be pronounced in prayers
and public harangues, without being ever construed as a reality in
calculating consequences and determining practical measures.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[p. 170]</span> Accordingly, they drew
from the mutilation of the Hermæ the inference, not less natural
than terrifying, that heavy public misfortune was impending over the
city, and that the political constitution to which they were attached
was in imminent danger of being subverted.<a id="FNanchor_249"
href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>Such was the mysterious incident which broke in upon the eager
and bustling movement of Athens, a few days before the Sicilian
expedition was in condition for starting. In reference to that
expedition it was taken to heart as a most depressing omen.<a
id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
It would doubtless have been so determined, had it been a mere
undesigned accident happening to any venerated religious object,
just as we are told that similar misgivings were occasioned by
the occurrence, about this same time, of the melancholy festival
of the Adonia, wherein the women loudly bewailed the untimely
death of Adonis.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251"
class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The mutilation of the Hermæ, however, was
something much more ominous than the worst accident. It proclaimed
itself as the deliberate act of organized conspirators, not
inconsiderable in number, whose names and final purpose were<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[p. 171]</span> indeed unknown, but who
had begun by committing sacrilege of a character flagrant and unheard
of. For intentional mutilation of a public and sacred statue, where
the material afforded no temptation to plunder, is a case to which we
know no parallel: much more mutilation by wholesale, spread by one
band and in one night throughout an entire city. Though neither the
parties concerned, nor their purposes, were ever more than partially
made out, the concert and conspiracy itself is unquestionable.</p>

<p>It seems probable, as far as we can form an opinion, that the
conspirators had two objects, perhaps some of them one and some the
other: to ruin Alkibiadês, to frustrate or delay the expedition. How
they pursued the former purpose, will be presently seen: towards the
latter, nothing was ostensibly done, but the position of Teukrus,
and other metics implicated, renders it more likely that they were
influenced by sympathies with Corinth and Megara,<a id="FNanchor_252"
href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> prompting them
to intercept an expedition which was supposed to promise great
triumphs to Athens, rather than corrupted by the violent antipathies
of intestine politics. Indeed, the two objects were intimately
connected with each other; for the prosecution of the enterprise,
while full of prospective conquest to Athens, was yet more pregnant
with future power and wealth to Alkibiadês himself. Such chances
would disappear if the expedition could be prevented; nor was it at
all impossible that the Athenians, under the intense impression of
religious terror consequent on the mutilation of the Hermæ, might
throw up the scheme altogether. Especially Nikias, exquisitely
sensitive in his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[p.
172]</span> religious conscience, and never hearty in his wish for
going, a fact perfectly known to the enemy,<a id="FNanchor_253"
href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> would hasten to
consult his prophets, and might reasonably be expected to renew his
opposition on the fresh ground offered to him, or at least to claim
delay until the offended gods should have been appeased. We may judge
how much such a proceeding was in the line of his character, and
of the Athenian character, when we find him, two years afterwards,
with the full concurrence of his soldiers, actually sacrificing the
last opportunity of safe retreat for the half-ruined Athenian army
in Sicily, and refusing even to allow the proposition to be debated,
in consequence of an eclipse of the moon; and when we reflect that
Spartans and other Greeks frequently renounced public designs if
an earthquake happened before the execution.<a id="FNanchor_254"
href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>But though the chance of setting aside the expedition altogether
might reasonably enter into the plans of the conspirators, as a
likely consequence of the intense shock inflicted on the religious
mind of Athens, and especially of Nikias, this calculation was not
realized. Probably matters had already proceeded too far even for
Nikias to recede. Notice had been sent round to all the allies;
forces were already on their way to the rendezvous at Korkyra; the
Argeian and Mantineian allies were arriving at Peiræus to embark.
So much the more eagerly did the conspirators proceed in the other
part of their plan, to work that exaggerated religious terror, which
they had themselves artificially brought about, for the ruin of
Alkibiadês.</p>

<p>Few men in Athens either had or deserved to have a greater number
of enemies, political as well as private, than Alkibiades; many
of them being among the highest citizens, whom he offended by his
insolence, and whose liturgies and other customary exhibitions he
outshone by his reckless expenditure. His importance had been already
so much increased, and threatened to be so much more increased, by
the Sicilian enterprise, that they no longer observed any measures in
compassing his ruin. That which the mutilators of the Hermæ seem to
have deliberately planned, his other enemies were ready to turn to
profit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[p. 173]</span></p>

<p>Amidst the mournful dismay spread by the discovery of so
unparalleled a sacrilege, it appeared to the Athenian people,—as
it would have appeared to the ephors at Sparta, or to the rulers
in every oligarchical city of Greece,—that it was their paramount
and imperative duty to detect and punish the authors. So long as
these latter were walking about unknown and unpunished, the temples
were defiled by their presence, and the whole city was accounted
under the displeasure of the gods, who would inflict upon it heavy
public misfortunes.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255"
class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Under this displeasure every citizen felt
himself comprehended, so that the sense of public security as well
as of private comfort were alike unappeased, until the offenders
should be discovered and atonement made by punishing or expelling
them. Large rewards were accordingly proclaimed to any person who
could give information, and even impunity to any accomplice whose
confession might lay open the plot. Nor did the matter stop here.
Once under this painful shock of religious and political terror,
the Athenians became eager talkers and listeners on the subject of
other recent acts of impiety. Every one was impatient to tell all
that he knew, and more than he knew, about such incidents; while
to exercise any strict criticism upon the truth of such reports,
would argue weakness of faith and want of religious zeal, rendering
the critic himself a suspected man, “metuunt dubitasse videri.”
To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[p. 174]</span> rake out
and rigorously visit all such offenders, and thus to display an
earnest zeal for the honor of the gods, was accounted one auxiliary
means of obtaining absolution from them for the recent outrage.
Hence an additional public vote was passed, promising rewards and
inviting information from all witnesses,—citizens, metics, or even
slaves,—respecting any previous acts of impiety which might have come
within their cognizance,<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256"
class="fnanchor">[256]</a> but at the same time providing that
informers who gave false depositions should be punished capitally.<a
id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>The Senate of Five Hundred were invested with full powers of
action; while Diognêtus, Peisander, Chariklês, and others, were
named commissioners for receiving and prosecuting inquiries, and
public assemblies were held nearly every day to receive reports.<a
id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> The
first informations received, however, did not relate to the grave
and recent mutilation of the Hermæ, but to analogous incidents of
older date; to certain defacements of other statues, accomplished in
drunken frolic; and above all, to ludicrous ceremonies celebrated
in various houses,<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259"
class="fnanchor">[259]</a> by parties of revellers<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[p. 175]</span> caricaturing and
divulging the Eleusinian mysteries. It was under this latter head
that the first impeachment was preferred against Alkibiadês.</p>

<p>So fully were the preparations of the armament now complete,
that the trireme of Lamachus—who was doubtless more diligent about
the military details than either of his two colleagues—was already
moored in the outer harbor, and the last public assembly was held
for the departing officers,<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260"
class="fnanchor">[260]</a> who probably laid before their countrymen
an imposing account of the force assembled, when Pythonikus rose to
impeach Alkibiadês. “Athenians,” said he, “you are going to despatch
this great force and incur all this hazard, at a moment when I am
pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[p. 176]</span>pared to show
you that your general Alkibiadês is one of the profaners of the
holy mysteries, in a private house. Pass a vote of impunity, and
I will produce to you forthwith a slave of one here present, who,
though himself not initiated in the mysteries, shall repeat to you
what they are. Deal with me in any way you choose, if my statement
prove untrue.” While Alkibiadês strenuously denied the allegation,
the prytanes—senators presiding over the assembly, according to
the order determined by lot for that year among the ten tribes—at
once made proclamation for all uninitiated citizens to depart from
the assembly, and went to fetch the slave—Andromachus by name—whom
Pythonikus had indicated. On being introduced, Andromachus deposed
before the assembly that he had been with his master in the house of
Polytion, when Alkibiadês, Nikiadês, and Melêtus, went through the
sham celebration of the mysteries; many other persons being present,
and especially three other slaves besides himself. We must presume
that he verified this affirmation by describing what the mysteries
were which he had seen, the test which Pythonikus had offered.<a
id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>Such was the first direct attack made upon Alkibiadês by his
enemies. Pythonikus, the demagogue Androklês, and other speakers,
having put in evidence this irreverent proceeding,—probably in
substance true,—enlarged upon it with the strongest invective,
imputed to him many other acts of the like character, and even
denounced him as cognizant of the recent mutilation of the Hermæ.
All had been done, they said, with a view to accomplish his
purpose of subverting the democracy, when bereft of its divine
protectors; a purpose manifested by the constant tenor of his
lawless, overbearing, antipopular demeanor. Infamous as this calumny
was, so far as regarded the mutilation of the Hermæ,—for whatever
else Alkibiadês may have done, of that act he was unquestionably
innocent, being the very person who had most to lose by it, and whom
it ultimately ruined,—they calculated upon the reigning excitement
to get it accredited, and probably to procure his deposition from
the command, preparatory to public trial. But in spite of all the
disquietude arising from the recent sacrilege, their expectations
were de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[p. 177]</span>feated.
The strenuous denial of Alkibiadês, aided by his very peculiar
position as commander of the armament, as well as by the reflection
that the recent outrage tended rather to spoil his favorite projects
in Sicily, found general credence. The citizens enrolled to serve,
manifested strong disposition to stand by him; the allies from Argos
and Mantineia were known to have embraced the service chiefly at
his instigation; the people generally had become familiar with him
as the intended conqueror in Sicily, and were loth to be balked of
this project. From all these circumstances, his enemies, finding
little disposition to welcome the accusations which they preferred,
were compelled to postpone them until a more suitable time.<a
id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>But Alkibiadês saw full well the danger of having such charges
hanging over his head, and the peculiar advantage which he derived
from his accidental position at the moment. He implored the people
to investigate the charges at once; proclaiming his anxiety to
stand trial and even to suffer death, if found guilty,—accepting
the command only in case he should be acquitted,—and insisting
above all things on the mischief to the city, of sending him on
such an expedition with the charge undecided, as well as on the
hardship to himself, of being aspersed by calumny during his absence,
without power of defence. Such appeals, just and reasonable in
themselves, and urged with all the vehemence of a man who felt that
the question was one of life or death to his future prospects, were
very near prevailing. His enemies could only defeat them by the
trick of putting up fresh speakers, less notorious for hostility to
Alkibiadês. These men affected a tone of candor, deprecated the delay
which would be occasioned in the departure of the expedition, if he
were put upon his trial forthwith, and proposed deferring the trial
until a certain number of days after his return.<a id="FNanchor_263"
href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Such was the
determi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[p. 178]</span>nation
ultimately adopted; the supporters of Alkibiadês probably not fully
appreciating its consequences, and conceiving that the speedy
departure of the expedition was advisable even for his interest,
as well as agreeable to their own feelings. And thus his enemies,
though baffled in their first attempt to bring on his immediate ruin,
carried a postponement which insured to them leisure for thoroughly
poisoning the public mind against him, and choosing their own time
for his trial. They took care to keep back all farther accusation
until he and the armament had departed.<a id="FNanchor_264"
href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[p. 179]</span></p>

<p>The spectacle of its departure was indeed so imposing, and the
moment so full of anxious interest, that it banished even the
recollection of the recent sacrilege. The entire armament was not
mustered at Athens; for it had been judged expedient to order most
of the allied contingents to rendezvous at once at Korkyra. But
the Athenian force alone was astounding to behold. There were one
hundred triremes, sixty of which were in full trim for rapid nautical
movement, while the remaining forty were employed as transports for
the soldiers. There were fifteen hundred select citizen hoplites,
chosen from the general muster-roll, and seven hundred Thêtes, or
citizens too poor to be included in the muster-roll, who served as
hoplites on shipboard,—epibatæ, or marines,—each with a panoply
furnished by the state. To these must be added, five hundred
Argeian and two hundred and fifty Mantineian hoplites, paid by
Athens and transported on board Athenian ships.<a id="FNanchor_265"
href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The number of
horsemen was so small, that all were conveyed in a single horse
transport. But the condition, the equipment, the pomp both of wealth
and force, visible in the armament, was still more impressive than
the number. At daybreak on the day appointed, when all the ships were
ready in Peiræus, for departure, the military force was marched down
in a body from the city and embarked. They were accompanied by nearly
the whole population, metics and foreigners as well as citizens,
so that the appearance was that of a collective emigration, like
the flight to Salamis sixty-five years before. While the crowd of
foreigners, brought thither by curiosity, were amazed by the grandeur
of the spectacle, the citizens accompanying were moved by deeper
and more stirring anxieties. Their sons, brothers, relatives, and
friends, were just starting on the longest and largest enterprise
which Athens had ever undertaken; against an island extensive as
well as powerful, known to none of them accurately, and into a
sea of undefined possibilities; glory and profit on the one side,
but hazards of unassignable magnitude on the other. At this final
parting, ideas of doubt and danger became far more painfully present
than they had been in any of the preliminary<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_180">[p. 180]</span> discussions; and in spite of all
the reassuring effect of the unrivalled armament before them, the
relatives now separating at the water’s edge could not banish the
dark presentiment that they were bidding each other farewell for the
last time.</p>

<p>The moment immediately succeeding this farewell—when all the
soldiers were already on board, and the keleustês was on the point
of beginning his chant to put the rowers in motion—was peculiarly
solemn and touching. Silence having been enjoined and obtained by
sound of trumpet, both the crews in every ship and the spectators
on shore followed the voice of the herald in praying to the gods
for success, and in singing the pæan. On every deck were seen bowls
of wine prepared, out of which the officers and the epibatæ made
libations, with goblets of silver and gold. At length the final
signal was given, and the whole fleet quitted Peiræus in single
file, displaying the exuberance of their yet untried force by a race
of speed as far as Ægina.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266"
class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Never in Grecian history was an invocation
more unanimous, emphatic, and imposing, addressed to the gods; never
was the refusing nod of Zeus more stern or peremptory. All these
details, given by Thucydidês, of the triumphant promise which now
issued from Peiræus, derive a painful interest from their contrast
with the sad issue which will hereafter be unfolded.</p>

<p>The fleet made straight for Korkyra, where the contingents of the
maritime allies, with the ships for burden and provisions, were found
assembled. The armament thus complete was passed in review, and found
to comprise one hundred and thirty-four triremes with two Rhodian
pentekonters; five thousand one hundred hoplites; four hundred and
eighty bowmen, eighty of them Kretan; seven hundred Rhodian slingers;
and one hundred and twenty Megarian exiles serving as light troops.
Of vessels of burden, in attendance with provisions, muniments
of war, bakers, masons, and carpenters, etc., the number was not
less than five hundred; besides which, there was a considerable
number of private trading-ships, following it voluntarily for
purposes of profit.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267"
class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Three fast-sailing triremes were
despatched in advance to ascertain which of the cities in Italy and
Sicily would welcome the arrival of the armament; and especially
to give notice at Egesta,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[p.
181]</span> that the succor solicited was now on its way, requiring
at the same time that the money promised by the Egestæans should be
produced. Having then distributed by lot the armament into three
divisions, one under each of the generals, Nikias, Alkibiadês, and
Lamachus, they crossed the Ionic gulf from Korkyra to the Iapygian
promontory.</p>

<p>In their progress southward along the coast of Italy to Rhegium,
they met with a very cold reception from the various Grecian
cities. None would receive them within their walls or even sell
them provisions without. The utmost which they would grant was, the
liberty of taking moorings and of watering; and even thus much was
denied to them both at Tarentum and at the Epizephyrian Lokri. At
Rhegium, immediately on the Sicilian strait, though the town-gate
was still kept shut, they were so far more hospitably treated, that
a market of provisions was furnished to them, and they were allowed
to encamp in the sacred precinct of Artemis, not far from the walls.
They here hauled their ships ashore and took repose until the return
of the three scout-ships from Egesta; while the generals entered into
negotiation with the magistrates and people of Rhegium, endeavoring
to induce them to aid the armament in reëstablishing the dispossessed
Leontines, who were of common Chalkidian origin with themselves. But
the answer returned was discouraging. The Rhegines would promise
nothing more than neutrality, and coöperation in any course of policy
which it might suit the other Italian Greeks to adopt. Probably they,
as well as the other Italian Greeks, were astonished and intimidated
by the magnitude of the newly-arrived force, and desired to leave
themselves open latitude of conduct for the future, not without
mistrust of Athens and her affected forwardness for the restoration
of the Leontines. To the Athenian generals, however, such a negative
from Rhegium was an unwelcome disappointment; for that city had
been the ally of Athens in the last war, and they had calculated
on the operation of Chalkidic sympathies.<a id="FNanchor_268"
href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>It was not until after the muster of the Athenians at Korkyra,
about July 415 <small>B.C.</small>, that the Syracusans
became thoroughly convinced both of their approach, and of the extent
of their designs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[p. 182]</span>
against Sicily. Intimation had indeed reached Syracuse, from several
quarters, of the resolution taken by the Athenians in the preceding
March to assist Egesta and Leontini, and of the preparations going
on in consequence. There was, however, a prevailing indisposition
to credit such tidings. Nothing in the state of Sicily held out any
encouragement to Athenian ambition: the Leontines could give no aid,
the Egestæans very little, and that little at the opposite corner of
the island; while the Syracusans considered themselves fully able to
cope with any force which Athens was likely to send. Some derided the
intelligence as mere idle rumor; others anticipated, at most, nothing
more serious than the expedition sent from Athens ten years before.<a
id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
No one could imagine the new eagerness and obstinacy with which she
had just thrown herself into the scheme of Sicilian conquest, nor
the formidable armament presently about to start. Nevertheless, the
Syracusan generals thought it their duty to make preparations, and
strengthen the military condition of the state.<a id="FNanchor_270"
href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>Hermokratês, however, whose information was more complete, judged
these preparations insufficient, and took advantage of a public
assembly—held seemingly about the time that the Athenians were
starting from Peiræus—to impress such conviction on his countrymen,
as well as to correct their incredulity. He pledged his own credit
that the reports which had been circulated were not merely true, but
even less than the full truth; that the Athenians were actually on
their way, with an armament on the largest scale, and vast designs
of conquering all Sicily. While he strenuously urged that the city
should be put in immediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[p.
183]</span> condition for repelling a most formidable invasion, he
deprecated all alarm as to the result, and held out the firmest
assurances of ultimate triumph. The very magnitude of the approaching
force would intimidate the Sicilian cities and drive them into hearty
defensive coöperation with Syracuse. Rarely indeed did any large
or distant expedition ever succeed in its object, as might be seen
from the failure of the Persians against Greece, by which failure
Athens herself had so largely profited. Preparations, however, both
effective and immediate, were indispensable; not merely at home, but
by means of foreign missions, to the Sicilian and Italian Greeks,
to the Sikels, and to the Carthaginians, who had for some time been
suspicious of the unmeasured aggressive designs of Athens, and whose
immense wealth would now be especially serviceable, and to Lacedæmon
and Corinth, for the purpose of soliciting aid in Sicily, as well as
renewed invasion of Attica. So confident did he (Hermokratês) feel
of their powers of defence, if properly organized, that he would
even advise the Syracusans with their Sicilian<a id="FNanchor_271"
href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> allies to put to sea
at once, with all their naval force and two months’ provisions, and
to sail forthwith to the friendly harbor of Tarentum, from whence
they would be able to meet the Athenian fleet and prevent it even
from crossing the Ionic gulf from Korkyra. They would thus show
that they were not only determined on defence, but even forward in
coming to blows: the only way of taking down the presumption of the
Athenians, who now speculated upon Syracusan lukewarmness, because
they had rendered no aid to Sparta when she solicited it at the
beginning of the war. The Syracusans would probably be able to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[p. 184]</span> deter or obstruct
the advance of the expedition until winter approached: in which
case Nikias, the ablest of the three generals, who was understood
to have undertaken the scheme against his own consent, would
probably avail himself of the pretext to return.<a id="FNanchor_272"
href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>Though these opinions of Hermokratês were espoused farther by
various other citizens in the assembly, the greater number of
speakers held an opposite language, and placed little faith in his
warnings. We have already noticed Hermokratês nine years before as
envoy of Syracuse and chief adviser at the congress of Gela,—then,
as now, watchful to bar the door against Athenian interference in
Sicily,—then, as now, belonging to the oligarchical party, and of
sentiments hostile to the existing democratical constitution; but
brave as well as intelligent in foreign affairs. A warm and even
angry debate arose upon his present speech.<a id="FNanchor_273"
href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Though there was
nothing, in the words of Hermokratês himself, disparaging either
to the democracy or to the existing magistrates, yet it would
seem that his partisans who spoke after him must have taken up a
more criminative tone, and must have exaggerated that which he
characterized as the “habitual quiescence” of the Syracusans,
into contemptible remissness and disorganization under those
administrators and generals, characterized as worthless, whom the
democracy preferred. Amidst the speakers, who, in replying to
Hermokratês and the others, indignantly repelled such insinuations
and retorted upon their authors, a citizen named Athenagoras
was the most distinguished. He was at this time the leading
democratical politician, and the most popular orator, in Syracuse.<a
id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[p. 185]</span></p>

<p>“Every one<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275"
class="fnanchor">[275]</a> (said he), except only cowards and bad
citizens, must wish that the Athenians <i>would</i> be fools enough to
come here and put themselves into our power. The tales which you
have just heard are nothing better than fabrications, got up to
alarm you; and I wonder at the folly of these alarmists in fancying
that their machinations are not seen through.<a id="FNanchor_276"
href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> You will be too
wise to take measure of the future from their reports: you will
rather judge from what able men, such as the Athenians, are likely
to do. Be assured that they will never leave behind them the
Peloponnesians in menacing attitude, to come hither and court a fresh
war not less formidable: indeed, I think they account themselves
lucky that we, with our powerful cities, have never come across to
attack them. And if they <i>should</i> come, as it is pretended, they
will find Sicily a more formidable foe than Peloponnesus: nay, our
own city alone will be a match for twice the force which they can
bring across. The Athenians, knowing all this well enough, will
mind their own business, in spite of all the fictions which men
on this side of the water conjure up, and which they have already
tried often before, sometimes even worse than on the present
occasion, in order to terrify you, and get themselves nominated
to the chief posts.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277"
class="fnanchor">[277]</a> One of these days, I fear they may even
succeed, from our want of precautions before<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_186">[p. 186]</span>hand. Such intrigues leave but short
moments of tranquillity to our city; they condemn it to an intestine
discord worse than foreign war, and have sometimes betrayed it
even to despots and usurpers. However, if you will listen to me, I
will try and prevent anything of this sort at present; by simple
persuasion to you, by chastisement to these conspirators, and by
watchful denunciation of the oligarchical party generally. Let
me ask, indeed, what is it that you younger nobles covet? To get
into command at your early age? The law forbids you, because you
are yet incompetent. Or, do you wish not to be under equal laws
with the many? But how can you pretend that citizens of the same
city should not have the same rights? Some one will tell me<a
id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
that democracy is neither intelligent nor just, and that the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[p. 187]</span> rich are the persons
best fitted to command. But I affirm, first, that the people are
the sum total, and the oligarchy merely a fraction; next, that rich
men are the best trustees of the aggregate wealth existing in the
community,—intelligent men, the best counsellors,—and the multitude,
the best qualified for hearing and deciding after such advice. In a
democracy, these functions, one and all, find their proper place.
But oligarchy, though imposing on the multitude a full participation
in all hazards, is not content even with an exorbitant share in the
public advantages, but grasps and monopolizes the whole for itself.<a
id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
This is just what you young and powerful men are aiming at, though
you will never be able to keep it permanently in a city such as
Syracuse. Be taught by me, or at least alter your views, and devote
yourselves to the public advantage of our common city. Desist from
practising, by reports such as these, upon the belief of men who know
you too well to be duped. If even there be any truth in what you say,
and if the Athenians <i>do</i> come, our city will repel them in a manner
worthy of her reputation. She will not take you at your word, and
choose <i>you</i> commanders, in order to put the yoke upon her own neck.
She will look for herself, construe your communications for what they
really mean, and, instead of suffering you to talk her out of her
free government, will take effective precautions for maintaining it
against you.”</p>

<p>Immediately after this vehement speech from Athenagoras, one of
the stratêgi who presided in the assembly interposed; permitting
no one else to speak, and abruptly closing the assembly, with
these few words: “We generals deprecate this interchange of
personal vituperation, and trust that the hearers present will not
suffer themselves to be biased by it. Let us rather take care, in
reference to the reports just communicated,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_188">[p. 188]</span> that we be one and all in a condition
to repel the invader. And even should the necessity not arise, there
is no harm in strengthening our public force with horses, arms, and
the other muniments of war. <i>We</i> generals shall take upon ourselves
the care and supervision of these matters, as well as of the missions
to neighboring cities, for procuring information and for other
objects. We have, indeed, already busied ourselves for the purpose,
and we shall keep you informed of what we learn.”</p>

<p>The language of Athenagoras, indicating much virulence of party
feeling, lets us somewhat into the real working of politics among
the Syracusan democracy. Athenagoras at Syracuse was like Kleon
at Athens, the popular orator of the city. But he was by no means
the most influential person, nor had he the principal direction of
public affairs. Executive and magisterial functions belonged chiefly
to Hermokratês and his partisans, the opponents of Athenagoras.
Hermokratês has already appeared as taking the lead at the congress
of Gela nine years before, and will be seen throughout the coming
period almost constantly in the same position; while the political
rank of Athenagoras is more analogous to that which we should call a
leader of opposition, a function of course suspended under pressing
danger, so that we hear of him no more. At Athens as at Syracuse,
the men who got to real power and handled the force and treasures of
the state, were chiefly of the rich families, often of oligarchical
sentiments, acquiescing in the democracy as an uncomfortable
necessity, and continually open to be solicited by friends or kinsmen
to conspire against it. Their proceedings were doubtless always
liable to the scrutiny, and their persons to the animadversion, of
the public assembly: hence arose the influence of the demagogue,
such as Athenagoras and Kleon, the bad side of whose character is so
constantly kept before the readers of Grecian history. By whatever
disparaging epithets such character may be surrounded, it is in
reality the distinguishing feature of a free government under all
its forms, whether constitutional monarchy or democracy. By the side
of the real political actors, who hold principal office and wield
personal powers, there are always abundant censors and critics,—some
better, others worse, in respect of honesty, candor, wisdom, or
rhetoric,—the most distinguished of whom acquires considerable
importance, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[p.
189]</span> holding a function essentially inferior to that of the
authorized magistrate or general.</p>

<p>We observe here, that Athenagoras, far from being inclined to push
the city into war, is averse to it, even beyond reasonable limit;
and denounces it as the interested policy of the oligarchical party.
This may show how little it was any constant interest or policy on
the part of the persons called demagogues, to involve their city
in unnecessary wars: a charge which has been frequently advanced
against them, because it so happens that Kleon, in the first half
of the Peloponnesian war, discountenanced the propositions of peace
between Athens and Sparta. We see by the harangue of Athenagoras
that the oligarchical party were the usual promoters of war: a fact
which we should naturally expect, seeing that the rich and great, in
most communities, have accounted the pursuit of military glory more
conformable to their dignity than any other career. At Syracuse, the
ascendency of Hermokratês was much increased by the invasion of the
Athenians, while Athenagoras does not again appear. The latter was
egregiously mistaken in his anticipations respecting the conduct of
Athens, though right in his judgment respecting her true political
interest. But it is very unsafe to assume that nations will always
pursue their true political interest, where present temptations
of ambition or vanity intervene. Positive information was in this
instance a surer guide than speculations <i>à priori</i> founded upon
the probable policy of Athens. But that the imputations advanced by
Athenagoras against the oligarchical youth, of promoting military
organization with a view to their own separate interest, were not
visionary, may be seen by the analogous case of Argos, two or
three years before. The democracy of Argos, contemplating a more
warlike and aggressive policy, had been persuaded to organize and
train the select regiment of one thousand hoplites, chosen from the
oligarchical youth: within three years, this regiment subverted the
democratical constitution.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280"
class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Now the persons, respecting whose designs
Athenagoras expresses so much apprehension, were exactly the class at
Syracuse corresponding to the select thousand at Argos.</p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[p. 190]</span></p> <p>The political
views, proclaimed in this remarkable speech, are deserving of
attention, though we cannot fully understand it without having before
us those speeches to which it replies. Not only is democratical
constitution forcibly contrasted with oligarchy, but the separate
places which it assigns to wealth, intelligence, and multitude, are
laid down with a distinctness not unworthy of Aristotle.</p>

<p>Even before the debate here adverted to, the Syracusan generals
had evidently acted upon views more nearly approaching to those
of Hermokratês than to those of Athenagoras. Already alive to the
danger, they were apprized by their scouts when the Athenian armament
was passing from Korkyra to Rhegium, and pushed their preparations
with the utmost activity, distributing garrisons and sending
envoys among their Sikel dependencies, while the force within the
city was mustered and placed under all the conditions of war.<a
id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> The
halt of the Athenians at Rhegium afforded increased leisure for such
equipment. That halt was prolonged for more than one reason. In the
first place, Nikias and his colleagues wished to negotiate with the
Rhegines, as well as to haul ashore and clean their ships: next, they
awaited the return of the three scout-ships from Egesta: lastly, they
had as yet formed no plan of action in Sicily.</p>

<p>The ships from Egesta returned with disheartening news. Instead
of the abundant wealth which had been held forth as existing in that
town, and upon which the resolutions of the Athenians as to Sicilian
operations had been mainly grounded, it turned out that no more than
thirty talents in all could be produced. What was yet worse, the
elaborate fraud, whereby the Egestæans had duped the commissioners
on their first visit, was now exposed; and these commissioners, on
returning to Rhegium from their second visit, were condemned to the
mortification of proclaiming their own credulity, visited by severe
taunts and reproaches from the army. Disappointed in the source from
whence they had calculated on obtaining money,—for it appears that
both Alkibiadês and Lamachus had sincerely relied on the pecuniary
resources of Egesta, though Nikias was always mistrustful,—the
generals now discussed their plan of action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[p. 191]</span></p>

<p>Nikias—availing himself of the fraudulent conduct on the part
of the Egestæan allies, now become palpable—wished to circumscribe
his range of operations within the rigorous letter of the vote
which the Athenian assembly had passed. He proposed to sail at once
against Selinus; then, formally to require the Egestæans to provide
the means of maintaining the armament, or, at least, of maintaining
those sixty triremes which they themselves had solicited. Since this
requisition would not be realized, he would only tarry long enough to
obtain from the Selinuntines some tolerable terms of accommodation
with Egesta, and then return home; exhibiting, as they sailed along,
to all the maritime cities, this great display of Athenian naval
force. And while he would be ready to profit by any opportunity which
accident might present for serving the Leontines or establishing
new alliances, he strongly deprecated any prolonged stay in the
island for speculative enterprises, all at the cost of Athens.<a
id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>Against this scheme Alkibiadês protested, as narrow, timid,
and disgraceful to the prodigious force with which they had been
intrusted. He proposed to begin by opening negotiations with all
the other Sicilian Greeks,—especially Messênê, convenient both as
harbor for their fleet and as base of their military operations,—to
prevail upon them to coöperate against Syracuse and Selinus. With
the same view, he recommended establishing relations with the
Sikels of the interior, in order to detach such of them as were
subjects of Syracuse, as well as to insure supplies of provisions.
As soon as it had been thus ascertained what extent of foreign aid
might be looked for, he would open direct attack forthwith against
Syracuse and Selinus; unless, indeed, the former should consent to
reëstablish Leontini, and the latter to come to terms with Egesta.<a
id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>Lamachus, delivering his opinion last, dissented from both his
colleagues. He advised, that they should proceed at once, without
any delay, to attack Syracuse, and fight their battle under its
walls. The Syracusans, he urged, were now in terror and only
half-prepared for defence. Many of their citizens, and much<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[p. 192]</span> property, would
be found still lingering throughout the neighboring lands, not
yet removed within the walls, and might thus be seized for the
subsistence of their army;<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284"
class="fnanchor">[284]</a> while the deserted town and harbor
of Megara, very near to Syracuse both by land and by sea, might
be occupied by the fleet as a naval station. The imposing and
intimidating effect of the armament, not less than its real
efficiency, was now at the maximum, immediately after its arrival.
If advantage were taken of this first impression to strike an
instant blow at their principal enemy, the Syracusans would be
found destitute of the courage, not less than of the means, to
resist: but the longer such attack was delayed, the more this first
impression of dismay would be effaced, giving place to a reactionary
sentiment of indifference and even contempt, when the much-dreaded
armament was seen to accomplish little or nothing. As for the other
Sicilian cities, nothing would contribute so much to determine their
immediate adhesion, as successful operations against Syracuse.<a
id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>But Lamachus found no favor with either of the other two, and
being thus compelled to choose between the plans of Alkibiadês and
Nikias, gave his support to that of the former, which was the mean
term of the three. There can be no doubt—as far as it is becoming
to pronounce respecting that which never reached execution—that
the plan of Lamachus was far the best and most judicious; at first
sight, indeed, the most daring, but intrinsically the safest,
easiest, and speediest, that could be suggested. For undoubtedly the
siege and capture of Syracuse, was the one enterprise indispensable
towards the promotion of Athenian views in Sicily. The sooner that
was commenced, the more easily it would be accomplished: and its
difficulties were in many ways aggravated, in no way abated, by those
preliminary precautions upon which Alkibiadês insisted. Anything
like delay tended fearfully to impair the efficiency, real as well
as reputed, of an ancient aggressive armament, and to animate as
well as to strengthen those who stood on the defensive, a point
on which we shall find painful evidence presently. The advice of
Lamachus, alike soldier-like and far-sighted, would probably<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[p. 193]</span> have been approved and
executed either by Brasidas or by Demosthenês; while the dilatory
policy still advocated by Alkibiadês, even after the suggestion of
Lamachus had been started, tends to show that if he was superior in
military energy to one of his colleagues, he was not less inferior to
the other. Indeed, when we find him talking of besieging Syracuse,
<i>unless</i> the Syracusans would consent to the reëstablishment of
Leontini, it seems probable that he had not yet made up his mind
peremptorily to besiege the city at all; a fact completely at
variance with those unbounded hopes of conquest which he is reported
as having conceived even at Athens. It is possible that he may have
thought it impolitic to contradict too abruptly the tendencies of
Nikias, who, anxious as he was chiefly to find some pretext for
carrying back his troops unharmed, might account the proposition
of Lamachus too desperate even to be discussed. Unfortunately, the
latter, though the ablest soldier of the three, was a poor man, of
no political position, and little influence among the hoplites. Had
he possessed, along with his own straightforward military energy,
the wealth and family ascendency of either of his colleagues, the
achievements as well as the fate of this splendid armament would have
been entirely altered, and the Athenians would have entered Syracuse
not as prisoners but as conquerors.</p>

<p>Alkibiadês, as soon as his plan had become adopted by means of the
approval of Lamachus, sailed across the strait in his own trireme
from Rhegium to Messênê. Though admitted personally into the city,
and allowed to address the public assembly, he could not induce
them to conclude any alliance, or to admit the armament to anything
beyond a market of provisions without the walls. He accordingly
returned back to Rhegium, from whence he and one of his colleagues
immediately departed with sixty triremes for Naxos. The Naxians
cordially received the armament, which then steered southward along
the coast of Sicily to Katana. In the latter place the leading men
and the general sentiment were at this time favorable to Syracuse,
so that the Athenians, finding admittance refused, were compelled
to sail farther southward and take their night-station at the mouth
of the river Terias. On the ensuing day they made sail with their
ships in single column immediately in front of Syracuse itself,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[p. 194]</span> while an advanced
squadron of ten triremes were even despatched into the Great Harbor,
south of the town, for the purpose of surveying on this side the city
with its docks and fortifications, and for the farther purpose of
proclaiming from shipboard by the voice of the herald: “The Leontines
now in Syracuse are hereby invited to come forth without apprehension
and join their friends and benefactors, the Athenians.” After this
empty display, they returned back to Katana.<a id="FNanchor_286"
href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>We may remark that this proceeding was completely at variance with
the judicious recommendation of Lamachus. It tended to familiarize
the Syracusans with the sight of the armament piece-meal, without any
instant action, and thus to abate in their minds the terror-striking
impression of its first arrival.</p>

<p>At Katana, Alkibiadês personally was admitted into the town,
and allowed to open his case before the public assembly, as he had
been at Messênê. Accident alone enabled him to carry his point,
for the general opinion was averse to his propositions. While most
of the citizens were in the assembly listening to his discourse,
some Athenian soldiers without, observing a postern-gate carelessly
guarded, broke it open and showed themselves in the market-place.
The town was thus in the power of the Athenians, so that the leading
men who were friends of Syracuse thought themselves lucky to
escape in safety, while the general assembly came to a resolution
accepting the alliance proposed by Alkibiadês.<a id="FNanchor_287"
href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> The whole Athenian
armament was now conducted from Rhegium to Katana, which was
established as head-quarters. Intimation was farther received from
a party at Kamarina, that the city might be induced to join them,
if the armament showed itself: accordingly, the whole armament
proceeded thither, and took moorings off the shore, while a herald
was sent up to the city. But the Kamarinæans declined to admit the
army, and declared that they would abide by the existing treaty;
which bound them to receive at any time one single ship, but no more,
unless they themselves should ask for it. The Athenians were<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[p. 195]</span> therefore obliged to
return to Katana. Passing by Syracuse both going and returning,
they ascertained the falsehood of a report that the Syracusans were
putting a naval force afloat; moreover, they landed near the city
and ravaged some of the neighboring lands. The Syracusan cavalry and
light troops soon appeared, and a skirmish with trifling loss ensued,
before the invaders retired to their ships,<a id="FNanchor_288"
href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> the first blood shed
in this important struggle, and again at variance with the advice of
Lamachus.</p>

<p>Serious news awaited them on their return to Katana. They found
the public ceremonial trireme, called the Salaminian, just arrived
from Athens, the bearer of a formal resolution of the assembly,
requiring Alkibiadês to come home and stand his trial for various
alleged matters of irreligion combined with treasonable purposes.
A few other citizens specified by name were commanded to come
along with him under the same charge; but the trierarch of the
Salaminian was especially directed to serve him only with the
summons, without any guard or coercion, so that he might return
home in his own trireme.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289"
class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>This summons, pregnant with momentous results both to Athens
and to her enemies, arose out of the mutilation of the Hermæ,
described a few pages back, and the inquiries instituted into the
authorship of that deed, since the departure of the armament. The
extensive and anxious sympathies connected with so large a body of
departing citizens, combined with the solemnity of the scene itself,
had for the moment suspended the alarm caused by that sacrilege;
but it speedily revived, and the people could not rest without
finding out by whom the deed had been done. Considerable rewards,
one thousand and even ten thousand drachms, were proclaimed to
informers; of whom others soon appeared, in addition to the slave
Andromachus, before mentioned. A metic named Teukrus had fled from
Athens, immediately after the event, to Megara, from whence he sent
intimation to the senate at Athens that he had himself been a party
concerned in the recent sacrilege concerning the mysteries, as well
as cognizant of the mutilation of the Hermæ, and that, if impunity
were guaranteed to him, he would come back and give full<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[p. 196]</span> information. A vote
of the senate was immediately passed to invite him. He denounced by
name eleven persons as having been concerned, jointly with himself,
in the mock-celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries, and eighteen
different persons, himself not being one, as the violators of the
Hermæ. A woman named Agaristê, daughter of Alkmæonidês,—these names
bespeak her great rank and family in the city,—deposed farther that
Alkibiadês, Axiochus, and Adeimantus, had gone through a parody
of the mysteries in a similar manner, in the house of Charmidês.
And lastly Lydus, slave of a citizen named Phereklês, stated that
the like scene had been enacted in the house of his master in the
deme Thêmakus, giving the names of the parties present, one of
whom—though asleep, and unconscious of what was passing—he stated
to be Leogoras, the father of Andokidês.<a id="FNanchor_290"
href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Of the parties named
in these different depositions, the greater number seem to have fled
from the city at once; but all who remained were put into prison
to stand future trial.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291"
class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Those inform<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_197">[p. 197]</span>ers received the promised rewards,
after some debate as to the parties entitled to receive the reward;
for Pythonikus, the citizen who had produced the slave Andromachus,
pretended to the first claim, while Androkles, one of the senators,
contended that the senate collectively ought to receive<a
id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
the money; a strange pretension, which we do not know how he
justified. At last, however, at the time of the Panathenaic festival,
Andromachus the slave received the first reward of ten thousand
drachms; Teukrus the metic, the second reward of one thousand
drachms.</p>

<p>A large number of citizens, many of them of the first
consideration in the city, were thus either lying in prison or had
fled into exile. But the alarm, the agony, and the suspicion, in
the public mind, went on increasing rather than diminishing. The
information hitherto received had been all partial, and, with the
exception of Agaristê, all the informants had been either slaves or
metics, not citizens; while Teukrus, the only one among them who
had stated anything respecting the mutilation of the Hermæ, did not
profess to be a party concerned, or to know all those who were.<a
id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
The people had heard only a succession of disclosures, all attesting
a frequency of irreligious acts, calculated to insult and banish
the local gods who protected their country and constitution; all
indicating that there were many powerful citizens bent on prosecuting
such designs, interpreted as treasonable, yet none communicating
any full or satisfactory idea of the Hermo<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_198">[p. 198]</span>kopid plot, of the real conspirators,
or of their farther purposes. The enemy was among themselves,
yet they knew not where to lay hands upon him. Amidst the gloomy
terrors, political blended with religious, which distracted their
minds, all the ancient stories of the last and worst oppressions of
the Peisistratid despots, ninety-five years before, became again
revived, and some new despots, they knew not who, seemed on the
point of occupying the acropolis. To detect the real conspirators,
was the only way of procuring respite from this melancholy paroxysm,
for which purpose the people were willing to welcome questionable
witnesses, and to imprison on suspicion citizens of the best
character, until the truth could be ascertained.<a id="FNanchor_294"
href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>The public distraction was aggravated by Peisander and
Chariklês, who acted as commissioners of investigation, furious and
unprincipled politicians,<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295"
class="fnanchor">[295]</a> at that time professing exaggerated
attachment to the democratical constitution, though we shall find
both of them hereafter among the most unscrupulous agents in its
subversion. These men loudly proclaimed that the facts disclosed
indicated the band of Hermokopid conspirators to be numerous, with
an ulterior design of speedily putting down the democracy; and they
insisted on pressing their investigations until full discovery should
be attained. And the sentiment of the people, collectively taken,
responded to this stimulus; though individually, every man was so
afraid of becoming himself the next victim arrested, that when the
herald convoked the senate for the purpose of receiving informations,
the crowd in the market-place straightway dispersed.</p>

<p>It was amidst such eager thirst for discovery, that a new informer
appeared, Diokleidês, who professed to communicate some material
facts connected with the mutilation of the Hermæ, affirming that the
authors of it were three hundred in number. He recounted that, on
the night on which that incident occurred, he<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_199">[p. 199]</span> started from Athens to go to the
mines of Laureion; wherein he had a slave working on hire, on whose
account he was to receive pay. It was full moon, and the night was
so bright that he began his journey mistaking it for daybreak.<a
id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
On reaching the propylæum of the temple of Dionysus, he saw a
body of men about three hundred in number descending from the
Odeon towards the public theatre. Being alarmed at this unexpected
sight, he concealed himself behind a pillar, from whence he had
leisure to contemplate this body of men, who stood for some time
conversing together, in groups of fifteen or twenty each, and then
dispersed: the moon was so bright that he could discern the faces
of most of them. As soon as they had dispersed, he pursued his
walk to Laureion, from whence he returned next day, and learned to
his surprise that during the night the Hermæ had been mutilated;
also, that commissioners of inquiry had been named, and the reward
of ten thousand drachms proclaimed for information. Impressed at
once with the belief that the nocturnal crowd whom he had seen were
authors of the deed, he happened soon after<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_200">[p. 200]</span>wards to see one of them, Euphêmus,
sitting in the workshop of a brazier, and took him aside to the
neighboring temple of Hephæstus, where he mentioned in confidence
that he had seen the party at work and could denounce them, but that
he preferred being paid for silence, instead of giving information
and incurring private enmities. Euphêmus thanked him for the warning,
desiring him to come next day to the house of Leogoras and his son
Andokidês, where he would see them as well as the other parties
concerned. Andokidês and the rest offered to him, under solemn
covenant, the sum of two talents, or twelve thousand drachms, thus
overbidding the reward of ten thousand drachms proclaimed by the
senate to any truth-telling informer, with admission to a partnership
in the benefits of their conspiracy, supposing that it should
succeed. Upon his reply that he would consider the proposition, they
desired him to meet them at the house of Kallias son of Têleklês,
brother-in-law of Andokidês: which meeting accordingly took place,
and a solemn bargain was concluded in the acropolis. Andokidês and
his friends engaged to pay the two talents to Diokleidês at the
beginning of the ensuing month, as the price of his silence. But
since this engagement was never performed, Diokleidês came with his
information to the senate.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297"
class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>Such—according to the report of Andokidês—was the story of this
informer, which he concluded by designating forty-two individuals,
out of the three hundred whom he had seen. The first names whom
he specified were those of Mantitheus and Aphepsion, two senators
actually sitting among his audience. Next came the remaining forty,
among whom were Andokidês and many of his nearest relatives, his
father Leogoras, his first or second cousins and brother-in-law,
Charmidês, Taureas, Nisæus, Kalias son of Alkmæon, Phrynichus,
Eukratês (brother of Nikias the commander in Sicily), and Kritias.
But as there were a still greater number of names—assuming the
total of three hundred to be correct—which Diokleidês was unable to
specify, the commissioner Peisander proposed that Mantitheus and
Aphepsion should be at once seized and tortured, in order to force
them to disclose their accomplices; the psephism passed in the
archonship of Skamandrius, whereby it was unlawful to apply<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[p. 201]</span> the torture to any free
Athenian, being first abrogated. Illegal, not less than cruel, as
this proposition was, the senate at first received it with favor. But
Mantitheus and Aphepsion, casting themselves as suppliants upon the
altar in the senate-house, pleaded so strenuously for their rights
as citizens, to be allowed to put in bail and stand trial before
the dikastery, that this was at last granted.<a id="FNanchor_298"
href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> No sooner had they
provided their sureties, than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[p.
202]</span> they broke their covenant, mounted their horses, and
deserted to the enemy, without any regard to their sureties, who were
exposed by law to the same trial and the same penalties as would have
overtaken the offenders themselves. This sudden flight, together with
the news that a Bœotian force was assembled on the borders of Attica,
exasperated still farther the frantic terror of the public mind.
The senate at once took quiet measures for seizing and imprisoning
all the remaining forty whose names had been denounced; while by
concert with the strategi, all the citizens were put under arms;
those who dwelt in the city, mustering in the market-place; those in
and near the long walls, in the Theseium; those in Peiræus, in the
square called the Market-place of Hippodamus. Even the horsemen of
the city were convoked by sound of trumpet in the sacred precinct of
the Anakeion. The senate itself remained all night in the acropolis,
except the prytanes, or fifty senators of the presiding tribe, who
passed the night in the public building called the Tholus. Every
man in Athens felt the terrible sense of an internal conspiracy on
the point of breaking out, perhaps along with an invasion of the
foreigner, prevented only by the timely disclosure of Diokleidês, who
was hailed as the saviour of the city, and carried in procession to
dinner at the prytaneium.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299"
class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>Miserable as the condition of the city was generally, yet more
miserable was that of the prisoners confined; and worse, in every
way, was still to be looked for, since the Athenians would know
neither peace nor patience until they could reach, by some means
or other, the names of the undisclosed conspirators. The female
relatives and children of Andokidês, and his companions, were by
permission along with them in the prison,<a id="FNanchor_300"
href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> aggravating by their
tears and wailings the affliction of the scene, when Charmidês,
one of the parties confined, addressed himself to Andokidês, as
his cousin and friend, imploring him to make a voluntary dis<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[p. 203]</span>closure of all that he
knew, in order to preserve the lives of so many innocent persons,
his immediate kinsmen, as well as to rescue the city out of a
feverish alarm not to be endured. “You know (he said) all that passed
about the mutilation of the Hermæ, and your silence will now bring
destruction not only upon yourself, but also upon your father and
upon all of us; while if you inform, whether you have been an actor
in the scene or not, you will obtain impunity for yourself and us,
and at the same time soothe the terrors of the city.” Such instances
on the part of Charmidês,<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301"
class="fnanchor">[301]</a> aided by the supplications of the other
prisoners present, overcame the reluctance of Andokidês to become
informer, and he next day made his disclosures to the senate.
“Euphilêtus (he said) was the chief author of the mutilation of
the Hermæ. He proposed the deed at a convivial party where I was
present, but I denounced it in the strongest manner and refused all
compliance. Presently, I broke my collar-bone, and injured my head,
by a fall from a young horse, so badly as to be confined to my bed;
when Euphilêtus took the opportunity of my absence to assure the rest
of the company falsely that I had consented, and that I had agreed
to cut the Hermes near my paternal house, which the tribe Ægeïs
have dedicated. Accordingly, they executed the project, while I was
incapable of moving, without my knowledge: they presumed that <i>I</i>
would undertake the mutilation of this particular Hermes, and you see
that this is the only one in all Athens which has escaped injury.
When the conspirators ascertained that I had not been a party,
Euphilêtus and Melêtus threatened me with a terrible revenge unless I
observed silence: to which I replied that it was not I, but their own
crime, which had brought them into danger.”</p>

<p>Having recounted this tale, in substance, to the senate,
Andokidês tendered his slaves, both male and female, to be
tortured, in order that they might confirm his story that he was
in his bed and unable to leave it, on the night when the Hermæ
were mutilated. It appears that the torture was actually applied
(according to the custom so cruelly frequent at Athens in the case
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[p. 204]</span> slaves),
and that the senators thus became satisfied of the truth of what
Andokidês affirmed. He delivered in twenty-two names of citizens as
having been the mutilators of the Hermæ: eighteen of these names,
including Euphilêtus and Melêtus, had already been specified in
the information of Teukrus; the remaining four, were Panætius,
Diakritus, Lysistratus, and Chæredêmus; all of whom fled, the instant
their names were mentioned, without waiting the chance of being
seized. As soon as the senate heard the story of Andokidês, they
proceeded to question Diokleidês over again; who confessed that
he had given a false deposition, and begged for mercy, mentioning
Alkibiadês the Phegusian—a relative of the commander in Sicily—and
Amiantus, as having suborned him to the crime. Both of them fled
immediately on this revelation; but Diokleidês was detained, sent
before the dikastery for trial, and put to death.<a id="FNanchor_302"
href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>The foregoing is the story which Andokidês, in the oration De
Mysteriis, delivered between fifteen and twenty years afterwards,
represented himself to have communicated to the senate at this
perilous crisis. But it probably is not the story which he really did
tell, certainly not that which his enemies represented him as having
told: least of all does it communicate the whole truth, or afford any
satisfaction to such anxiety and alarm as are described to have been
prevalent at the time. Nor does it accord with the brief information
of Thucydidês, who tells us that Andokidês impeached himself, along
with others, as participant in the mutilation.<a id="FNanchor_303"
href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Among the accomplices
against whom he informed, his enemies affirmed that his own nearest
relatives were included, though this latter statement is denied by
himself. We may be sure, therefore, that the tale which Andokidês
really told was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[p. 205]</span>
something very different from what now stands in his oration. But
what it really was we cannot make out; nor should we gain much even
if it could be made out, since even at the time, neither Thucydidês
nor other intelligent critics could determine how far it was true.
The mutilation of the Hermæ remained to them always an unexplained
mystery; though they accounted Andokidês the principal organizer.<a
id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>That which is at once most important and most incontestable, is
the effect produced by the revelations of Andokidês, true or false,
on the public mind at Athens. He was a young man of rank and wealth
in the city, belonging to the sacred family of the Kerykes,—said
to trace his pedigree to the hero Odysseus,—and invested on a
previous occasion with an important naval command; whereas the
preceding informers had been metics and slaves. Moreover, he was
making confession of his own guilt. Hence the people received his
communications with implicit confidence. They were delighted to
have got to the bottom of the terrible mystery: and the public mind
subsided from its furious terrors into comparative tranquillity.
The citizens again began to think themselves in safety and to
resume their habitual confidence in each other, while the hoplites
everywhere on guard were allowed to return to their homes.<a
id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
All the prisoners in cus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[p.
206]</span>tody on suspicion, except those against whom Andokidês
informed were forthwith released: those who had fled out of
apprehension, were allowed to return; while those whom he named as
guilty, were tried, convicted, and put to death. Such of them as had
already fled, were condemned to death in their absence, and a reward
offered for their heads.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306"
class="fnanchor">[306]</a> And though discerning men were not
satisfied with the evidence upon which these sentences were
pronounced, yet the general public fully believed themselves to have
punished the real offenders, and were thus inexpressibly relieved
from the depressing sense of unexpiated insult to the gods, as well
as of danger to their political constitution from the withdrawal
of divine protection.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307"
class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Andokidês himself was pardoned, and
was for the time an object, apparently, even of public gratitude,
so that his father Leogoras who had been among the parties
imprisoned, ventured to indict a senator named Speusippus for
illegal proceedings towards him, and obtained an almost unanimous
verdict from the dikastery.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308"
class="fnanchor">[308]</a> But the character of a statue-breaker and
an informer could never be otherwise than odious at Athens. Andokidês
was either banished by the indirect effect of a general disqualifying
decree; or at least found that he had made so many enemies, and
incurred so much obloquy, by his conduct in this affair, as to make
it necessary for him to quit the city. He remained in banishment
for many years, and seems never to have got clear of the hatred
which his conduct in this nefarious proceeding so well merited.<a
id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[p. 207]</span></p>

<p>But the comfort arising out of these disclosures respecting the
Hermæ, though genuine and inestimable at the moment, was soon again
disturbed. There still remained the various alleged profanations of
the Eleusinian mysteries, which had not yet been investigated or
brought to atonement; and these were the more sure to be pressed
home, and worked with a factitious exaggeration of pious zeal, since
the enemies of Alkibiadês were bent upon turning them to his ruin.
Among all the ceremonies of Attic religion, there was none more
profoundly or universally reverenced than the mysteries of Eleusis,
originally enjoined by the goddess Dêmêtêr herself, in her visit to
that place, to Eumolpus and the other Eleusinian patriarch, and
transmitted as a precious hereditary privilege in their families.<a
id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
Celebrated annually in the month of August or September, under the
special care of the basileus, or second archon, these mysteries were
attended by vast crowds from Athens as well as from other parts
of Greece, presenting to the eye a solemn and imposing spectacle,
and striking the imagination still more powerfully by the special
initiation which they conferred, under pledge of secrecy, upon pious
and predisposed communicants. Even the divulgation in words to the
uninitiated, of that which was exhibited to the eye and ear of the
assembly in the interior of the Eleusinian temple, was accounted
highly criminal: much more the actual mimicry of these ceremonies for
the amusement of a convivial party. Moreover, the individuals who
held the great sacred offices at Eleusis,—the hierophant, the daduch
(torch-bearer), and the keryx, or herald,—which were transmitted by
inheritance in the Eumolpidæ and other great families of antiquity
and importance, were personally insulted by such proceedings, and
vindicated their own dignity at the same time that they invoked
punishment on the offenders in the name of Dêmêtêr and Persephonê.
The most appalling legends were current among the Athenian public,
and repeated on proper occasions even by the hierophant<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[p. 208]</span> himself, respecting
the divine judgments which always overtook such impious men.<a
id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>When we recollect how highly the Eleusinian mysteries were
venerated by Greeks not born in Athens and even by foreigners, we
shall not wonder at the violent indignation excited in the Athenian
mind by persons who profaned or divulged them; especially at a moment
when their religious sensibilities had been so keenly wounded,
and so tardily and recently healed, in reference to the Hermæ.<a
id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> It
was about this same time<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313"
class="fnanchor">[313]</a> that a prosecution was instituted against
the Melian philosopher Diagoras for irreligious doctrines. Having
left Athens before trial, he was found guilty in his absence, and a
reward was offered for his life.</p>

<p>Probably the privileged sacred families, connected with the
mysteries, were foremost in calling for expiation from the
state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[p. 209]</span> to
the majesty of the two offended goddesses, and for punishment
on the delinquents.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314"
class="fnanchor">[314]</a> And the enemies of Alkibiadês, personal
as well as political, found the opportunity favorable for reviving
that charge against him which they had artfully suffered to drop
before his departure to Sicily. The matter of fact alleged against
him—the mock-celebration of these holy ceremonies—was not only in
itself probable, but proved by reasonably good testimony against
him and some of his intimate companions. Moreover, the overbearing
insolence of demeanor habitual with Alkibiadês, so glaringly at
variance with the equal restraints of democracy, enabled his enemies
to impute to him not only irreligious acts, but anti-constitutional
purposes; an association of ideas which was at this moment the
more easily accredited, since his divulgation and parody of the
mysteries did not stand alone, but was interpreted in conjunction
with the recent mutilation of the Hermæ—as a manifestation of the
same anti-patriotic and irreligious feeling, if not part and parcel
of the same treasonable scheme. And the alarm on this subject was
now renewed by the appearance of a Lacedæmonian army at the isthmus,
professing to contemplate some enterprise in conjunction with the
Bœotians, a purpose not easy to understand, and presenting every
appearance of being a cloak for hostile designs against Athens. So
fully was this believed among the Athenians, that they took arms,
and remained under arms one whole night in the sacred precinct of
the Theseium. No enemy indeed appeared, either without or within;
but the conspiracy had only been prevented from breaking out, so
they imagined, by the recent inquiries and detection. Moreover, the
party in Argos connected with Alkibiadês were just at this time
suspected of a plot for the subversion of their own democracy,
which still farther aggravated the presumptions against him, while
it induced the Athenians to give up to the Argeian democratical
government the oligarchical hostages which had been taken from that
town a few months before,<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315"
class="fnanchor">[315]</a> in order that it might put these hostages
to death, whenever it thought fit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[p. 210]</span></p>

<p>Such incidents materially aided the enemies of Alkibiadês in their
unremitting efforts to procure his recall and condemnation. Among
them were men very different in station and temper: Thessalus son of
Kimon, a man of the highest lineage and of hereditary oligarchical
politics, as well as Androklês, a leading demagogue or popular
orator. It was the former who preferred against him in the senate the
memorable impeachment, which, fortunately for our information, is
recorded verbatim.</p>

<p>“Thessalus son of Kimon, of the deme Lakiadæ, hath impeached
Alkibiadês son of Kleinias, of the deme Skambônidæ, as guilty of
crime in regard to the two goddesses Dêmêtêr and Persephonê, in
mimicking the mysteries, and exhibiting them to his companions in
his own house, wearing the costume of the hierophant: applying to
himself the name of hierophant; to Polytion, that of daduch; to
Theodôrus that of herald, and addressing his remaining companions
as mysts and epopts; all contrary to the sacred customs and
canons, of old established by the Eumolpidæ, the Kerykes, and the
Eleusinian priests.”<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316"
class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>Similar impeachments being at the same time presented against
other citizens now serving in Sicily along with Alkibiadês, the
accusers moved that he and the rest might be sent for to come home
and take their trial. We may observe that the indictment against him
is quite distinct and special, making no allusion to any supposed
treasonable or anti-constitutional projects: probably, however,
these suspicions were pressed by his enemies in their preliminary
speeches, for the purpose of inducing the Athenians to remove him
from the command of the army forthwith, and send for him home.
For such a step it was indispensable that a strong case should be
made out: but the public was at length thoroughly brought round,
and the Salaminian trireme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[p.
211]</span> was despatched to Sicily to fetch him. Great care however
was taken, in sending this summons, to avoid all appearance of
prejudgment, or harshness, or menace. The trierarch was forbidden
to seize his person, and had instructions to invite him simply to
accompany the Salaminian home in his own trireme: so as to avoid the
hazard of offending the Argeian and Mantineian allies serving in
Sicily, or the army itself.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317"
class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>It was on the return of the Athenian army from their unsuccessful
attempt at Kamarina, to their previous quarters at Katana, that
they found the Salaminian trireme newly arrived from Athens with
this grave requisition against the general. We may be sure that
Alkibiadês received private intimation from his friends at Athens,
by the same trireme, communicating to him the temper of the people,
so that his resolution was speedily taken. Professing to obey, he
departed in his own trireme on the voyage homeward, along with the
other persons accused, the Salaminian trireme being in company; but
as soon as they arrived at Thurii, in coasting along Italy, he and
his companions quitted the vessel and disappeared. After a fruitless
search on the part of the Salaminian trierarch, the two triremes
were obliged to return to Athens without him. Both Alkibiadês
and the rest of the accused—one of whom<a id="FNanchor_318"
href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> was his own cousin
and namesake—were tried, condemned to death on non-appearance,
and their property confiscated; while the Eumolpidæ and the other
Eleusinian sacred families pronounced him to be accursed by the
gods, for his desecration of the mysteries,<a id="FNanchor_319"
href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> and recorded the
condemnation on a plate of lead.</p>

<p>Probably his disappearance and exile were acceptable to his
enemies at Athens: at any rate, they thus made sure of getting rid
of him; while had he come back, his condemnation to death,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[p. 212]</span> though probable, could
not be considered as certain. In considering the conduct of the
Athenians towards Alkibiadês, we have to remark, that the people were
guilty of no act of injustice. He had committed—at least there was
fair reason for believing that he had committed—an act criminal in
the estimation of every Greek; the divulgation and profanation of
the mysteries. This act—alleged against him in the indictment very
distinctly, divested of all supposed ulterior purpose, treasonable
or otherwise—was legally punishable at Athens, and was universally
accounted guilty in public estimation, as an offence at once against
the religious sentiment of the people and against the public safety,
by offending the two goddesses, Dêmêtêr and Persephonê, and driving
them to withdraw their favor and protection. The same demand for
legal punishment would have been supposed to exist in a Christian
Catholic country, down to a very recent period of history, if instead
of the Eleusinian mysteries we suppose the sacrament of the mass to
have been the ceremony ridiculed; though such a proceeding would
involve no breach of obligation to secrecy. Nor ought we to judge
what would have been the measure of penalty formerly awarded to a
person convicted of such an offence, by consulting the tendency of
penal legislation during the last sixty years. Even down to the
last century it would have been visited with something sharper than
the draught of hemlock, which is the worst that could possibly have
befallen Alkibiadês at Athens, as we may see by the condemnation
and execution of the Chevalier de la Barre at Abbeville, in 1766.
The uniform tendency of Christian legislation,<a id="FNanchor_320"
href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> down to a recent
period, leaves no room for reproaching<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_213">[p. 213]</span> the Athenians with excessive cruelty in
their penal visitation of offences against the religious sentiment.
On the contrary, the Athenians are distinguished for comparative
mildness and tolerance, as we shall find various opportunities for
remarking.</p>

<p>Now in reviewing the conduct of the Athenians towards Alkibiadês,
we must consider, that this violation of the mysteries, of which
he was indicted in good legal form, was an action for which he
really deserved punishment, if any one deserved it. Even<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[p. 214]</span> his enemies did not
fabricate this charge, or impute it to him falsely; though they
were guilty of insidious and unprincipled manœuvres to exasperate
the public mind against him. Their machinations begin with the
mutilation of the Hermæ; an act of new and unparalleled wickedness,
to which historians of Greece seldom do justice. It was not, like
the violations of the mysteries, a piece of indecent pastime
committed within four walls, and never intended to become known.
It was an outrage essentially public, planned and executed by
conspirators for the deliberate purpose of lacerating the religious
mind of Athens, and turning the prevalent terror and distraction to
political profit. Thus much is certain; though we cannot be sure
who the conspirators were, nor what was their exact or special
purpose. That the destruction of Alkibiadês was one of the direct
purposes of the conspirators, is highly probable. But his enemies,
even if they were not among the original authors, at least took
upon themselves half the guilt of the proceeding, by making it the
basis of treacherous machinations against his person. How their
scheme, which was originally contrived to destroy him before the
expedition departed, at first failed, was then artfully dropped,
and at length effectually revived, after a long train of calumny
against the absent general, has been already recounted. It is among
the darkest chapters of Athenian political history, indicating, on
the part of the people, strong religious excitability, without any
injustice towards Alkibiadês; but indicating, on the part of his
enemies, as well as of the Hermokopids generally, a depth of wicked
contrivance rarely paralleled in political warfare. It is to these
men, not to the people, that Alkibiadês owes his expulsion, aided
indeed by the effect of his own previous character. In regard to the
Hermæ, the Athenians condemned to death—after and by consequence of
the deposition of Andokidês—a small number of men who may perhaps
have been innocent victims, but whom they sincerely believed to be
guilty; and whose death not only tranquillized comparatively the
public mind, but served as the only means of rescue to a far larger
number of prisoners confined on suspicion. In regard to Alkibiadês,
they came to no collective resolution, except that of recalling
him to take his trial, a resolution implying no wrong in those
who voted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[p. 215]</span> for
it, whatever may be the guilt of those who proposed and prepared
it by perfidious means.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321"
class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_216">[p. 216]</span></p> <p>In order to appreciate the
desperate hatred with which the exile Alkibiadês afterwards revenged
himself on his countrymen, it has been necessary to explain to
what extent he had just ground of complaint against them. On being
informed that they had condemned him to death in his absence, he
is said to have exclaimed: “I shall show them that I am alive.” He
fully redeemed his word.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322"
class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>The recall and consequent banishment of Alkibiadês was
mischievous to Athens in several ways. It transferred to the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[p. 217]</span> enemy’s camp an angry
exile, to make known her weak points, and to rouse the sluggishness
of Sparta. It offended a portion of the Sicilian armament, most
of all probably the Argeians and Mantineians, and slackened their
zeal in the cause.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323"
class="fnanchor">[323]</a> And what was worst of all, it left the
armament altogether under the paralyzing command of Nikias. For
Lamachus, though still equal in nominal authority, and now invested
with the command of one-half instead of one-third of the army,
appears to have had no real influence except in the field.</p>

<p>Nikias now proceeded to execute that scheme which he had first
suggested, to sail round from Katana to Selinus and Egesta, with
the view of investigating the quarrel between the two as well as
the financial means of the latter. Passing through the strait and
along the north coast of the island, he first touched at Himera,
where admittance was refused to him; he next captured a Sikanian
maritime town named Hykkara, together with many prisoners; among
them the celebrated courtezan Laïs, then a very young girl.<a
id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
Having handed over this place to the Egestæans, Nikias went in
person to inspect their city and condition; but could obtain no more
money than the thirty talents which had been before announced on the
second visit of the commissioners. He then restored the prisoners
from Hykkara to their Sikanian countrymen, receiving a ransom of one
hundred and twenty talents,<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325"
class="fnanchor">[325]</a> and conducted the Athenian land-force
across the centre of the island, through the territory of the
friendly Sikels to Katana; making an attack in his way upon the
hostile Sikel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[p. 218]</span>
town of Hybla, in which he was repulsed. At Katana he was rejoined by
his naval force.</p>

<p>It was now seemingly about the middle of October, and three
months had elapsed since the arrival of the Athenian armament at
Rhegium; during which period they had achieved nothing except the
acquisition of Naxus and Katana as allies—unless we are to reckon
the insignificant capture of Hykkara. But Naxus and Katana, as
Chalkidic cities, had been counted upon beforehand even by Nikias;
together with Rhegium, which had been found reluctant, to his great
disappointment. What is still worse, in reference to the character
of the general, not only nothing serious had been achieved, but
nothing serious had been attempted. The precious moment pointed
out by Lamachus for action, when the terrific menace of the recent
untried armament was at its maximum, and preparation as well as
confidence was wanting at Syracuse, had been irreparably wasted.
Every day the preparations of the Syracusans improved and their fears
diminished; the invader, whom they had looked upon as so formidable,
turned out both hesitating and timorous,<a id="FNanchor_326"
href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> and when he had
disappeared out of their sight to Hykkara and Egesta, still more when
he assailed in vain the insignificant Sikel post of Hybla, their
minds underwent a reaction from dismay to extreme confidence. The
mass of Syracusan citizens, now reinforced by allies from Selinus
and other cities, called upon their generals to lead to the attack
of the Athenian position at Katana, since the Athenians did not dare
to approach Syracuse; while Syracusan horsemen even went so far as
to insult the Athenians in their camp, riding up to ask if they
were come to settle as peaceable citizens in the island, instead of
restoring the Leontines. Such unexpected humiliation, acting probably
on the feelings of the soldiers, at length shamed Nikias out of his
inaction, and compelled him to strike a blow for the maintenance of
his own reputation. He devised a stratagem for approaching Syracuse
in such a manner as to elude the opposition of the Syracusan cavalry,
informing himself as to the ground near the city, through some exiles
serving along with him.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327"
class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>He despatched to Syracuse a Katanæan citizen, in his heart<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[p. 219]</span> attached to Athens, yet
apparently neutral and on good terms with the other side, as bearer
of a pretended message and proposition from the friends of Syracuse
at Katana. Many of the Athenian soldiers, so the message ran, were
in the habit of passing the night within the walls, apart from their
camp and arms. It would be easy for the Syracusans by a vigorous
attack at daybreak, to surprise them thus unprepared and dispersed;
while the philo-Syracusan party at Katana promised to aid, by closing
the gates, assailing the Athenians within, and setting fire to the
ships. A numerous body of Katanæans, they added, were eager to
coöperate in the plan now proposed.</p>

<p>This communication, reaching the Syracusan generals at a moment
when they were themselves elate and disposed to an aggressive
movement, found such incautious credence, that they sent back the
messenger to Katana with cordial assent and agreement for a precise
day. Accordingly, a day or two before, the entire Syracusan force
was marched out towards Katana, and encamped for the night on the
river Symæthus, in the Leontine territory, within about eight miles
of Katana. But Nikias, with whom the whole proceeding originated,
choosing this same day to put on shipboard his army, together with
his Sikel allies present, sailed by night southward along the coast,
rounding the island of Ortygia, into the Great Harbor of Syracuse.
Arrived thither by break of day, he disembarked his troops unopposed
south of the mouth of the Anâpus, in the interior of the Great
Harbor, near the hamlet which stretched towards the temple of Zeus
Olympius. Having broken down the neighboring bridge, where the
Helôrine road crossed the Anâpus, he took up a position protected by
various embarrassing obstacles,—houses, walls, trees, and standing
water, besides the steep ground of the Olympieion itself on his
left wing; so that he could choose his own time for fighting, and
was out of the attack of the Syracusan horse. For the protection of
his ships on the shore, he provided a palisade work by cutting down
the neighboring trees; and even took precautions for his rear by
throwing up a hasty fence of wood and stones touching the shore at
the inner bay called Daskon. He had full leisure for such defensive
works, since the enemy within the walls made no attempt to disturb
him, while the Syracusan horse only discovered his manœuvre on
arriving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[p. 220]</span> before
the lines at Katana; and though they lost no time in returning, the
march back was a long one.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328"
class="fnanchor">[328]</a> Such was the confidence of the Syracusans,
however, that even after so long a march, they offered battle
forthwith; but as Nikias did not quit his position, they retreated,
to take up their night-station on the other side of the Helôrine
road, probably a road bordered on each side by walls.</p>

<p>On the next morning, Nikias marched out of his position and
formed his troops in order of battle, in two divisions, each
eight deep. His front division was intended to attack; his rear
division—in hollow square, with the baggage in the middle—was held
in reserve near the camp, to lend aid where aid might be wanted;
cavalry there was none. The Syracusan hoplites, seemingly far more
numerous than his, presented the levy in mass of the city, without
any selection; they were ranged in the deeper order of sixteen,
alongside of their Selinuntine allies. On the right wing were
posted their horsemen, the best part of their force, not less than
twelve hundred in number; together with two hundred horsemen from
Gela, twenty from Kamarina, about fifty bowmen, and a company of
darters. The hoplites, though full of courage, had little training;
and their array, never precisely kept, was on this occasion farther
disturbed by the immediate vicinity of the city. Some had gone in to
see their families; others, hurrying out to join, found the battle
already begun, and took rank wherever they could.<a id="FNanchor_329"
href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>Thucydidês, in describing this battle, gives us, according to his
practice, a statement of the motives and feelings which animated the
combatants on both sides, and which furnished a theme for the brief
harangue of Nikias. This appears surprising to one accustomed to
modern warfare, where the soldier is under the influence simply of
professional honor and disgrace, without any thought of the cause
for which he is fighting. In ancient times, such a motive was only
one among many others, which, according to the circumstances of the
case, contributed to elevate or depress the soldier’s mind at the eve
of action. Nikias adverted to the recognized military preëminence
of chosen Argeians, Mantine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[p.
221]</span>ians, and Athenians, as compared to the Syracusan levy in
mass, who were full of belief in their own superiority,—this is a
striking confession of the deplorable change which had been wrought
by his own delay,—but who would come short in actual conflict,
from want of discipline.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330"
class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Moreover, he reminded them that they were
far away from home, and that defeat would render them victims, one
and all, of the Syracusan cavalry. He little thought, nor did his
prophets forewarn him, that such a calamity, serious as it would
have been, was even desirable for Athens, since it would have saved
her from the far more overwhelming disasters which will be found to
sadden the coming chapters of this history.</p>

<p>While the customary sacrifices were being performed, the slingers
and bowmen on both sides became engaged in skirmishing. But presently
the trumpets sounded, and Nikias ordered his first division of
hoplites to charge at once rapidly, before the Syracusans expected
it. Judging from his previous backwardness, they never imagined that
he would be the first to give orders for charging; nor was it until
they saw the Athenian line actually advancing towards them that they
lifted their own arms from the ground and came forward to give the
meeting. The shock was bravely encountered on both sides, and for
some time the battle continued hand to hand with undecided result.
There happened to supervene a violent storm of rain, with thunder
and lightning, which alarmed the Syracusans, who construed it as an
unfavorable augury, while to the more practised Athenian hoplites,
it seemed a mere phenomenon of the season,<a id="FNanchor_331"
href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> so that they still
farther astonished the Syracusans by the unabated confidence<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[p. 222]</span> with which they
continued the fight. At length the Syracusan army was broken,
dispersed, and fled; first, before the Argeians on the right, next,
before the Athenians in the centre. The victors pursued as far as
was safe and practicable, without disordering their ranks: for the
Syracusan cavalry, which had not yet been engaged, checked all who
pressed forward, and enabled their own infantry to retire in safety
behind the Helôrine road.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332"
class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>So little were the Syracusans dispirited with this defeat, that
they did not retire within their city until they had sent an adequate
detachment to guard the neighboring temple and sacred precinct of
the Olympian Zeus, wherein there was much deposited wealth, which
they feared that the Athenians might seize. Nikias, however, without
approaching the sacred ground, contented himself with occupying the
field of battle, burnt his own dead, and stripped the arms from
the dead of the enemy. The Syracusans and their allies lost two
hundred and fifty men, the Athenians fifty.<a id="FNanchor_333"
href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>On the morrow, having granted to the Syracusans their dead
bodies for burial, and collected the ashes of his own dead, Nikias
reëmbarked his troops, put to sea, and sailed back to his former
station at Katana. He conceived it impossible, without cavalry and
a farther stock of money, to maintain his position near Syracuse or
to prosecute immediate operations of siege or blockade. And as the
winter was now approaching, he determined to take up winter quarters
at Katana; though considering the mild winter at Syracuse, and the
danger of marsh fever near the Great Harbor in summer, the change of
season might well be regarded as a questionable gain. But he proposed
to employ the interval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[p.
223]</span> in sending to Athens for cavalry and money, as well
as in procuring the like reinforcements from his Sicilian allies,
whose numbers he calculated now on increasing by the accession of
new cities after his recent victory, and to get together magazines
of every kind for beginning the siege of Syracuse in the spring.
Despatching a trireme to Athens with these requisitions, he sailed
with his forces to Messênê, within which there was a favorable party
who gave hopes of opening the gates to him. Such a correspondence
had already been commenced before the departure of Alkibiadês: but
it was the first act of revenge which the departing general took
on his country, to betray the proceedings to the philo-Syracusan
party in Messênê. Accordingly, these latter, watching their
opportunity, rose in arms before the arrival of Nikias, put to
death their chief antagonists, and held the town by force against
the Athenians; who after a fruitless delay of thirteen days, with
scanty supplies and under stormy weather, were forced to return to
Naxos, where they established a palisaded camp and station, and
went into winter quarters.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334"
class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>The recent stratagem of Nikias, followed by the movement into
the harbor of Syracuse, and the battle, had been ably planned and
executed. It served to show the courage and discipline of the army,
as well as to keep up the spirits of the soldiers themselves, and
to obviate those feelings of disappointment which the previous
inefficiency of the armament tended to arouse. But as to other
results, the victory was barren; we may even say, positively
mischievous, since it imparted a momentary stimulus which served
as an excuse to Nikias for the three months of total inaction
which followed, and since it neither weakened nor humiliated the
Syracusans, but gave them a salutary lesson which they turned to
account while Nikias was in his winter quarters. His apathy during
these first eight months after the arrival of the expedition at
Rhegium (from July 415 <small>B.C.</small> to March
414 <small>B.C.</small>), was the most deplorable of
all calamities to his army, his country, and himself. Abundant
proofs of this will be seen in the coming events: at present, we
have only to turn back to his own predictions and recommendations.
All the difficulties and dangers to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_224">[p. 224]</span> be surmounted in Sicily had been
foreseen by himself and impressed upon the Athenians: in the first
instance, as grounds against undertaking the expedition; but the
Athenians, though unfortunately not allowing them to avail in that
capacity, fully admitted their reality, and authorized him to demand
whatever force was necessary to overcome them.<a id="FNanchor_335"
href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> He had thus been
allowed to bring with him a force calculated upon his own ideas,
together with supplies and implements for besieging; yet when
arrived, he seems only anxious to avoid exposing that force in
any serious enterprise, and to find an excuse for conducting it
back to Athens. That Syracuse was the grand enemy, and that the
capital point of the enterprise was the siege of that city, was
a truth familiar to himself as well as every man at Athens:<a
id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
upon the formidable cavalry of the Syracusans, Nikias had himself
insisted, in the preliminary debates. Yet, after four months of mere
trifling, and pretence of action so as to evade dealing with the
real difficulty, the existence of this cavalry is made an excuse
for a farther postponement of four months until reinforcements
can be obtained from Athens. To all the intrinsic dangers of the
case, predicted by Nikias himself with proper discernment, was
thus superadded the aggravated danger of his own factitious delay;
frittering away the first impression of his armament, giving the
Syracusans leisure to enlarge their fortifications, and allowing
the Peloponnesians time to interfere against Attica as well as to
succor Sicily. It was the unhappy weakness of this commander to
shrink from decisive resolutions of every kind, and at any rate to
postpone them until the necessity became imminent: the consequence of
which was,—to use an expression of the Corinthian envoy before the
Peloponnesian war in censuring the dilatory policy of Sparta,—that
never acting, yet always seeming about to act, he found his enemy in
double force instead of single, at the moment of actual conflict.<a
id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>Great, indeed, must have been the disappointment of the Athe<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[p. 225]</span>nians, when, after
having sent forth in the month of June, an expedition of unparalleled
efficiency, they receive in the month of November a despatch to
acquaint them that the general has accomplished little except one
indecisive victory; and that he has not even attempted anything
serious, nor can do so unless they send him farther cavalry and
money. Yet the only answer which they made was, to grant and provide
for this demand without any public expression of discontent or
disappointment against him.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338"
class="fnanchor">[338]</a> And this is the more to be noted, since
the re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[p. 226]</span>moval
of Alkibiadês afforded an inviting and even valuable opportunity
for proposing to send out a fresh colleague in his room.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[p. 227]</span> If there were no
complaints raised against Nikias at Athens, so neither are we
informed of any such, even among his own soldiers in Sicily, though
<i>their</i> disappointment must have been yet greater than that of their
countrymen at home, considering the expectations with which they
had come out. We may remember that the delay of a few days at Eion,
under perfectly justifiable circumstances, and while awaiting the
arrival of reinforcements actually sent for, raised the loudest
murmurs against Kleon in his expedition against Amphipolis, from the
hoplites in his own army.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339"
class="fnanchor">[339]</a> The contrast is instructive, and will
appear yet more instructive as we advance forward.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Syracusans were profiting by the lesson of their
recent defeat. In the next public assembly which ensued, Hermokratês
addressed them in the mingled tone of encouragement and admonition.
He praised their bravery, while he deprecated their want of tactics
and discipline. Considering the great superiority of the enemy in
this last respect, he regarded the recent battle as giving good
promise for the future; and he appealed with satisfaction to the
precautions taken by Nikias in fortifying his camp, as well as to
his speedy retreat after the battle. He pressed them to diminish
the excessive number of fifteen generals, whom they had hitherto
been accustomed to nominate to the command; to reduce the number
to three, conferring upon them at the same<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_228">[p. 228]</span> time fuller powers than had been before
enjoyed, and swearing a solemn oath to leave them unfettered in the
exercise of such powers; lastly, to enjoin upon these generals the
most strenuous efforts, during the coming winter, for training and
arming the whole population. Accordingly Hermokratês himself, with
Herakleidês and Sikanus, were named to the command. Ambassadors were
sent both to Sparta and to Corinth, for the purpose of entreating
assistance in Sicily, as well as of prevailing on the Peloponnesians
to recommence a direct attack against Attica;<a id="FNanchor_340"
href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> so as at least to
prevent the Athenians from sending farther reinforcements to Nikias,
and perhaps even to bring about the recall of his army.</p>

<p>But by far the most important measure which marked the
nomination of the new generals, was, the enlargement of the line of
fortifications at Syracuse. They constructed a new wall, inclosing
an additional space and covering both their inner and their outer
city to the westward, reaching from the outer sea to the Great
Harbor, across the whole space fronting the rising slope of the
hill of Epipolæ, and stretching far enough westward to inclose
the sacred precinct of Apollo Temenites. This was intended as a
precaution, in order that if Nikias, resuming operations in the
spring, should beat them in the field and confine them to their
walls, he might, nevertheless, be prevented from carrying a wall
of circumvallation from sea to sea without covering a great
additional extent of ground.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341"
class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Besides this, the Syracusans fitted up
and garrisoned the deserted town of Megara, on the coast to the
north of Syracuse; they established a regular fortification and
garrison in the Olympieion or temple of Zeus Olympius, which they
had already garrisoned after the recent battle with Nikias; and they
planted stakes in the sea to obstruct the convenient landing-places.
All these precautions were useful to them; and we may even say
that the new outlying fortification, inclosing the Temenites,
proved their salvation in the coming siege, by so lengthening the
circumvallation necessary for the Athenians to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_229">[p. 229]</span> construct, that Gylippus had time to
arrive before it was finished. But there was one farther precaution
which the Syracusans omitted at this moment, when it was open to
them without any hindrance, to occupy and fortify the Euryâlus, or
the summit of the hill of Epipolæ. Had they done this now, probably
the Athenians could never have made progress with their lines of
circumvallation: but they did not think of it until too late, as we
shall presently see.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it is important to remark, in reference to the
general scheme of Athenian operations in Sicily, that if Nikias
had adopted the plan originally recommended by Lamachus, or if
he had begun his permanent besieging operations against Syracuse
in the summer or autumn of 415 <small>B.C.</small>,
instead of postponing them, as he actually did, to the spring of
414 <small>B.C.</small>, he would have found none of
these additional defences to contend against, and the line of
circumvallation necessary for his purpose would have been shorter
and easier. Besides these permanent and irreparable disadvantages,
his winter’s inaction at Naxos drew upon him the farther insult,
that the Syracusans marched to his former quarters at Katana and
burned the tents which they found standing, ravaging at the same time
the neighboring fields.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342"
class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>Kamarina maintained an equivocal policy which made both parties
hope to gain it; and in the course of this winter the Athenian envoy
Euphêmus with others was sent thither to propose a renewal of that
alliance, between the city and Athens, which had been concluded
ten years before. Hermokratês the Syracusan went to counteract his
object; and both of them, according to Grecian custom, were admitted
to address the public assembly.</p>

<p>Hermokratês began by denouncing the views, designs, and past
history of Athens. He did not, he said, fear her power, provided the
Sicilian cities were united and true to each other: even against
Syracuse alone, the hasty retreat of the Athenians after the recent
battle had shown how little they confided in their own strength. What
he did fear, was, the delusive promises and insinuations of Athens,
tending to disunite the island, and to paralyze all joint resistance.
Every one knew that her purpose in this expedition was to subjugate
all Sicily,—that Leontini and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[p.
230]</span> Egesta served merely as convenient pretences to put
forward,—and that she could have no sincere sympathy for Chalkidians
in Sicily, when she herself held in slavery the Chalkidians in Eubœa.
It was, in truth, nothing else but an extension of the same scheme
of rapacious ambition, whereby she had reduced her Ionian allies and
kinsmen to their present wretched slavery, now threatened against
Sicily. The Sicilians could not too speedily show her that they
were no Ionians, made to be transferred from one master to another,
but autonomous Dorians from the centre of autonomy, Peloponnesus.
It would be madness to forfeit this honorable position through
jealousy or lukewarmness among themselves. Let not the Kamarinæans
imagine that Athens was striking her blow at Syracuse alone: they
were themselves next neighbors of Syracuse, and would be the first
victims if she were conquered. They might wish, from apprehension or
envy, to see the superior power of Syracuse humbled, but this could
not happen without endangering their own existence. They ought to do
for her what they would have asked her to do if the Athenians had
invaded Kamarina, instead of lending merely nominal aid, as they had
hitherto done. Their former alliance with Athens was for purposes
of mutual defence, not binding them to aid her in schemes of pure
aggression. To hold aloof, give fair words to both parties, and leave
Syracuse to fight the battle of Sicily single-handed, was as unjust
as it was dishonorable. If she came off victor in the struggle, she
would take care that the Kamarinæans should be no gainers by such
a policy. The state of affairs was so plain, that he (Hermokratês)
could not pretend to enlighten them: but he solemnly appealed to
their sentiments of common blood and lineage. The Dorians of Syracuse
were assailed by their eternal enemies the Ionians, and ought not
to be now betrayed by their own brother Dorians of Kamarina.<a
id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>Euphêmus, in reply, explained the proceedings of Athens in
reference to her empire, and vindicated her against the charges of
Hermokratês. Though addressing a Dorian assembly, he did not fear
to take his start from the position laid down by Hermokratês, that
Ionians were the natural enemies of Dorians. Under this feeling
Athens, as an Ionian city, had looked about to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_231">[p. 231]</span> strengthen herself against the
supremacy of her powerful Dorian neighbors in Peloponnesus. Finding
herself after the repulse of the Persian king at the head of those
Ionians and other Greeks who had just revolted from him, she had made
use of her position as well as of her superior navy to shake off
the illegitimate ascendency of Sparta. Her empire was justified by
regard for her own safety against Sparta, as well as by the immense
superiority of her maritime efforts in the rescue of Greece from
the Persians. Even in reference to her allies, she had good ground
for reducing them to subjection, because they had made themselves
the instruments and auxiliaries of the Persian king in his attempt
to conquer her. Prudential views for assured safety to herself had
thus led her to the acquisition of her present empire, and the same
views now brought her to Sicily. He was prepared to show that the
interests of Kamarina were in full accordance with those of Athens.
The main purpose of Athens in Sicily was to prevent her Sicilian
enemies from sending aid to her Peloponnesian enemies, to accomplish
which, powerful Sicilian allies were indispensable to her. To
enfeeble or subjugate her Sicilian allies would be folly: if she did
this, they would not serve her purpose of keeping the Syracusans
employed in their own island. Hence her desire to reëstablish the
expatriated Leontines, powerful and free, though she retained the
Chalkidians in Eubœa as subjects. Near home, she wanted nothing but
subjects, disarmed and tribute-paying, while in Sicily, she required
independent and efficient allies; so that the double conduct, which
Hermokratês reproached as inconsistent, proceeded from one and the
same root of public prudence. Pursuant to that motive, Athens dealt
differently with her different allies, according to the circumstances
of each. Thus, she respected the autonomy of Chios and Methymna, and
maintained equal relations with other islanders near Peloponnesus;
and such were the relations which she now wished to establish in
Sicily.</p>

<p>No: it was Syracuse, not Athens, whom the Kamarinæans and other
Sicilians had really ground to fear. Syracuse was aiming at the
acquisition of imperial sway over the island; and that which she had
already done towards the Leontines showed what she was prepared to do
when the time came, against Kamarina and others. It was under this
apprehension that the Kamari<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[p.
232]</span>næans had formerly invited Athens into Sicily: it would
be alike unjust and impolitic were they now to repudiate her aid,
for she could accomplish nothing without them; if they did so on the
present occasion, they would repent it hereafter when exposed to
the hostility of a constant encroaching neighbor, and when Athenian
auxiliaries could not again be had. He repelled the imputations
which Hermokratês had cast upon Athens, but the Kamarinæans were
not sitting as judges or censors upon her merits. It was for
them to consider whether that meddlesome disposition, with which
Athens was reproached, was not highly beneficial as the terror of
oppressors, and the shield of weaker states, throughout Greece. He
now tendered it to the Kamarinæans as their only security against
Syracuse; calling upon them, instead of living in perpetual fear
of her aggression, to seize the present opportunity of attacking
her on an equal footing, jointly with Athens.<a id="FNanchor_344"
href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>In these two remarkable speeches, we find Hermokratês renewing
substantially the same line of counsel as he had taken up ten years
before at the congress of Gela, to settle all Sicilian differences at
home, and above all things to keep out the intervention of Athens;
who if she once got footing in Sicily, would never rest until she
reduced all the cities successively. This was the natural point of
view for a Syracusan politician; but by no means equally natural,
nor equally conclusive, for an inhabitant of one of the secondary
Sicilian cities, especially of the conterminous Kamarina. And the
oration of Euphêmus is an able pleading to demonstrate that the
Kamarinæans had far more to fear from Syracuse than from Athens.
His arguments to this point are at least highly plausible, if not
convincing: but he seems to lay himself open to attack from the
opposite quarter. If Athens cannot hope to gain any subjects in
Sicily, what motive has she for interfering? This Euphêmus meets
by contending that if she does not interfere, the Syracusans and
their allies will come across and render assistance to the enemies
of Athens in Peloponnesus. It is manifest, however, that under the
actual circumstances of the time, Athens could have no real fears
of this nature, and that her real motives for meddling in Sicily
were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[p. 233]</span> those of
hope and encroachment, not of self-defence. But it shows how little
likely such hopes were to be realized, and therefore how ill-advised
the whole plan of interference in Sicily was,—that the Athenian envoy
could say to the Kamarinæans, in the same strain as Nikias had spoken
at Athens when combating the wisdom of the expedition: “Such is the
distance of Sicily from Athens, and such the difficulty of guarding
cities of great force and ample territory combined, that if we wished
to hold you Sicilians as subjects, we should be unable to do it: we
can only retain you as free and powerful allies.”<a id="FNanchor_345"
href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> What Nikias said
at Athens to dissuade his countrymen from the enterprise, under
sincere conviction, Euphêmus repeated at Kamarina for the purpose
of conciliating that city; probably, without believing it himself,
yet the anticipation was not on that account the less true and
reasonable.</p>

<p>The Kamarinæans felt the force of both speeches, from Hermokratês
and Euphêmus. Their inclinations carried them towards the Athenians,
yet not without a certain misgiving in case Athens should prove
completely successful. Towards the Syracusans, on the contrary, they
entertained nothing but unqualified apprehension, and jealousy of
very ancient date; and even now their great fear was, of probable
suffering, if the Syracusans succeeded against Athens without their
coöperation. In this dilemma, they thought it safest to give an
evasive answer, of friendly sentiment towards both parties, but
refusal of aid to either; hoping thus to avoid an inexpiable breach,
whichever way the ultimate success might turn.<a id="FNanchor_346"
href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>For a city comparatively weak and situated like Kamarina,
such was perhaps the least hazardous policy. In December, 415
<small>B.C.</small>, no human being could venture to predict how
the struggle between Nikias and the Syracusans in the coming year
would turn out; nor were the Kamarinæans prompted by any hearty
feeling to take the extreme chances with either party. Matters
had borne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[p. 234]</span> a
different aspect, indeed, in the preceding month of July 415 <small>B.C.</small>, when the Athenians first arrived. Had
the vigorous policy urged by Lamachus been then followed up, the
Athenians would always have appeared likely to succeed, if, indeed,
they had not already become conquerors of Syracuse; so that waverers
like the Kamarinæans would have remained attached to them from
policy. The best way to obtain allies, Lamachus had contended, was,
to be prompt and decisive in action, and to strike at the capital
point at once, while the intimidating effect of their arrival
was fresh. Of the value of his advice, an emphatic illustration
is afforded by the conduct of Kamarina.<a id="FNanchor_347"
href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>Throughout the rest of the winter, Nikias did little or nothing.
He merely despatched envoys for the purpose of conciliating the
Sikels in the interior, where the autonomous Sikels, who dwelt in
the central regions of the island, for the most part declared in
his favor,—especially the powerful Sikel prince Archônidês,—sending
provisions and even money to the camp at Naxos. Against some
refractory tribes, Nikias sent detachments for purposes of
compulsion; while the Syracusans on their part did the like to
counteract him. Such Sikel tribes as had become dependents of
Syracuse, stood aloof from the struggle. As the spring approached,
Nikias transferred his position from Naxos to Katana, reëstablishing
that camp which the Syracusans had destroyed.<a id="FNanchor_348"
href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>He farther sent a trireme to Carthage, to invite coöperation from
that city; and a second to the Tyrrhenian maritime cities on the
southern coast of Italy, some of whom had proffered to him their
services, as ancient enemies of Syracuse, and now realized their
promises. From Carthage nothing was obtained; why, we do not know;
for we shall find the Carthaginians, six years hence, invading
Sicily with prodigious forces; and if they entertained any such
intentions, it would seem that the presence of Nikias in Sicily must
have presented the most convenient moment for executing them. To the
Sikels, Egestæans, and all the other allies of Athens, Nikias sent
orders for bricks, iron bars, clamps, and everything suitable for the
wall of circumvallation, which was to be commenced with the first
burst of spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[p. 235]</span></p>

<p>While such preparations were going on in Sicily, debates of
portentous promise took place at Sparta. Immediately after the
battle near the Olympieion, and the retreat of Nikias into winter
quarters, the Syracusans had despatched envoys to Peloponnesus to
solicit reinforcements. Here, again, we are compelled to notice
the lamentable consequences arising out of the inaction of Nikias.
Had he commenced the siege of Syracuse on his first arrival, it
may be doubted whether any such envoys would have been sent to
Peloponnesus at all; at any rate, they would not have arrived in time
to produce decisive effects.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349"
class="fnanchor">[349]</a> After exerting what influence they could
upon the Italian Greeks in their voyage, the Syracusan envoys reached
Corinth, where they found the warmest reception and obtained promises
of speedy succor. The Corinthians furnished envoys of their own to
accompany them to Sparta, and to back their request for Lacedæmonian
aid.</p>

<p>They found at the congress at Sparta another advocate upon
whom they could not reasonably have counted, Alkibiadês. That
exile had crossed over from Thurii to the Eleian port of Kyllênê
in Peloponnesus in a merchant-vessel,<a id="FNanchor_350"
href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> and now appeared
at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[p. 236]</span> Sparta on
special invitation and safe-conduct from the Lacedæmonians; of whom
he was at first vehemently afraid, in consequence of having raised
against them that Peloponnesian combination which had given them so
much trouble before the battle of Mantineia. He now appeared, too,
burning with hostility against his country, and eager to inflict
upon her all the mischief in his power. Having been the chief evil
genius to plunge her, mainly for selfish ends of his own, into
this ill-starred venture, he was now about to do his best to turn
it into her irreparable ruin. His fiery stimulus, and unmeasured
exaggerations, supplied what was wanting in Corinthian and Syracusan
eloquence, and inflamed the tardy good-will of the Spartan ephors
into comparative decision and activity.<a id="FNanchor_351"
href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> His harangue in the
Spartan congress is given to us by Thucydidês, who may possibly
have heard it, as he was then himself in exile. Like the earlier
speech which he puts into the mouth of Alkibiadês at Athens, it is
characteristic in a high degree; and interesting in another point of
view as the latest composed speech of any length which we find in his
history. I give here the substance, without professing to translate
the words.</p>

<p>“First, I must address you, Lacedæmonians, respecting the
prejudices current against me personally, before I can hope to find
a fair hearing on public matters. You know it was I, who renewed
my public connection with Sparta, after my ancestors before me
had quarrelled with you and renounced it. Moreover, I assiduously
cultivated your favor on all points, especially by attentions to
your prisoners at Athens: but while I was showing all this zeal
towards you, you took the opportunity of the peace which you made
with Athens to employ my enemies as your agents, thus strengthening
their hands, and dishonoring me. It was this conduct of yours which
drove me to unite with the Argeians and Mantineians; nor ought you to
be angry with me for mischief which you thus drew upon yourselves.
Probably some of you hate me too, without any good reason, as a
forward partisan of democracy. My family were always opposed to the
Pei<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[p. 237]</span>sistratid
despots; and as all opposition to a reigning dynasty takes the
name of The People, so from that time forward we continued to act
as leaders of the people.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352"
class="fnanchor">[352]</a> Moreover, our established constitution
was a democracy, so that I had no choice but to obey, though I did
my best to maintain a moderate line of political conduct in the
midst of the reigning license. It was not my family, but others,
who in former times as well as now, led the people into the worst
courses, those same men who sent me into exile. I always acted as
leader, not of a party, but of the entire city; thinking it right to
uphold that constitution in which Athens had enjoyed her grandeur
and freedom, and which I found already existing.<a id="FNanchor_353"
href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> For as to democracy,
all we Athenians of common sense well knew its real character.
Personally, I have better reason than any one else to rail against
it, if one <i>could</i> say anything new about such confessed folly; but
I did not think it safe to change the government, while you were
standing by as enemies.</p>

<p>“So much as to myself personally: I shall now talk to you about
the business of the meeting, and tell you something more than you
yet know. Our purpose in sailing from Athens, was, first to conquer
the Sicilian Greeks; next, the Italian Greeks; afterwards, to make
an attempt on the Carthaginian empire and on Carthage herself. If
all or most of this succeeded, we were then to attack Peloponnesus.
We intended to bring to this enterprise the entire power of the
Sicilian and Italian Greeks, besides large numbers of Iberian and
other warlike barbaric mer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[p.
238]</span>cenaries, together with many new triremes built from the
abundant forests of Italy, and large supplies both of treasure and
provision. We could thus blockade Peloponnesus all round with our
fleet, and at the same time assail it with our land-force; and we
calculated, by taking some towns by storm and occupying others as
permanent fortified positions, that we should easily conquer the
whole peninsula, and then become undisputed masters of Greece. You
thus hear the whole scheme of our expedition from the man who knows
it best; and you may depend on it that the remaining generals will
execute all this, if they can. Nothing but your intervention can
hinder them. If, indeed, the Sicilian Greeks were all united, they
might hold out; but the Syracusans standing alone cannot, beaten as
they already have been in a general action, and blocked up as they
are by sea. If Syracuse falls into the hands of the Athenians, all
Sicily and all Italy will share the same fate; and the danger which I
have described will be soon upon you.</p>

<p>“It is not therefore simply for the safety of Sicily,—it is for
the safety of Peloponnesus,—that I now urge you to send across,
forthwith, a fleet with an army of hoplites as rowers; and what I
consider still more important than an army, a Spartan general to
take the supreme command. Moreover, you must also carry on declared
and vigorous war against Athens here, that the Syracusans may be
encouraged to hold out, and that Athens may be in no condition to
send additional reinforcements thither. You must farther fortify
and permanently garrison Dekeleia in Attica:<a id="FNanchor_354"
href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> that is the
contingency which the Athenians have always been most afraid of, and
which therefore you may know to be your best policy. You will thus
get into your own hands the live and dead stock of Attica, interrupt
the working of the silver mines at Laureion, deprive the Athenians of
their profits from judicial fines as well as of their landed revenue,
and dispose the subject-allies to withhold their tribute.</p>

<p>“None of you ought to think the worse of me because I make
this vigorous onset upon my country in conjunction with her<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[p. 239]</span> enemies, I who once
passed for a patriot.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355"
class="fnanchor">[355]</a> Nor ought you to mistrust my assurances,
as coming from the reckless passion of an exile. The worst enemies
of Athens are not those who make open war like you, but those
who drive her best friends into hostility. I loved my country,<a
id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
while I was secure as a citizen; I love her no more, now that I am
wronged. In fact, I do not conceive myself to be assailing a country
still mine; I am rather trying to win back a country now lost to me.
The real patriot is not he, who, having unjustly lost his country,
acquiesces in patience, but he whose ardor makes him try every means
to regain her.</p>

<p>“Employ me without fear, Lacedæmonians, in any service of danger
or suffering; the more harm I did you formerly as an enemy, the
more good I can now do you as a friend. But above all, do not
shrink back from instant operations both in Sicily and in Attica,
upon which so much depends. You will thus put down the power of
Athens, present as well as future; you will dwell yourselves in
safety; and you will become the leaders of undivided Hellas, by free
consent and without force.”<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357"
class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>Enormous consequences turned upon this speech, no less masterly
in reference to the purpose and the audience, than infamous as an
indication of the character of the speaker. If its contents became
known at Athens, as they probably did, the enemies of Alkibiadês
would be supplied with a justification of their most violent
political attacks. That imputation which they had taken so much
pains to fasten upon him, citing in proof of it alike his profligate
expenditure, overbearing insolence, and derision of the religious
ceremonies of the state,<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358"
class="fnanchor">[358]</a>—that he detested the democracy in his
heart, submitted to it only from necessity, and was watching for
the first safe opportunity of subverting it,—appears here in
his own language as matter of avowal and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_240">[p. 240]</span> boast. The sentence of condemnation
against him would now be unanimously approved, even by those who
at the time had deprecated it; and the people would be more firmly
persuaded than before of the reality of the association between
irreligious manifestations and treasonable designs. Doubtless the
inferences so drawn from the speech would be unsound, because it
represented, not the actual past sentiments of Alkibiadês, but those
to which he now found it convenient to lay claim. As far as so very
selfish a politician could be said to have any preference, democracy
was, in some respects, more convenient to him than oligarchy.
Though offensive to his taste, it held out larger prospects to
his love of show, his adventurous ambition, and his rapacity for
foreign plunder; while under an oligarchy, the jealous restraints
and repulses imposed on him by a few equals, would be perhaps more
galling to his temper than those arising from the whole people.<a
id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
He takes credit in his speech for moderation, as opposed to the
standing license of democracy. But this is a pretence absurd even to
extravagance, and which Athenians of all parties would have listened
to with astonishment. Such license as that of Alkibiadês had never
been seen at Athens; and it was the adventurous instincts of the
democracy towards foreign conquest, combined with their imperfect
apprehension of the limits and conditions under which alone their
empire could be permanently maintained, which he stimulated up to the
highest point, and then made use of for his own power and profit. As
against himself, he had reason for accusing his political enemies
of unworthy manœuvres, and even of gross political wickedness, if
they were authors or accomplices—as seems probable of some—in the
mutilation of the Hermæ. But most certainly, their public advice to
the commonwealth was far less mischievous than his. And if we are to
strike the balance of personal political merit between Alkibiadês
and his enemies, we must take into the comparison his fraud upon the
simplicity of the Lacedæmonian envoys, recounted in the last chapter
but one of this History.</p>

<p>If, then, that portion of the speech of Alkibiadês, wherein
he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[p. 241]</span> touches upon
Athenian politics and his own past conduct, is not to be taken as
historical evidence, just as little can we trust the following
portion in which he professes to describe the real purposes of Athens
in her Sicilian expedition. That any such vast designs as those which
he announces were ever really contemplated even by himself and his
immediate friends, is very improbable; that they were contemplated
by the Athenian public, by the armament, or by Nikias, is utterly
incredible. The tardiness and timid movements of the armament—during
the first eight months after arriving at Rhegium—recommended by
Nikias, partially admitted even by Alkibiadês, opposed only by the
unavailing wisdom of Lamachus, and not strongly censured when known
at Athens, conspire to prove that their minds were not at first
fully made up even to the siege of Syracuse; that they counted on
alliances and money in Sicily which they did not find; and that
those who sailed from Athens with large hopes of brilliant and easy
conquest were soon taught to see the reality with different eyes.
If Alkibiadês had himself conceived at Athens the designs which he
professed to reveal in his speech at Sparta, there can be no doubt
that he would have espoused the scheme of Lamachus, or rather would
have originated it himself. We find him, indeed, in his speech
delivered at Athens before the determination to sail, holding out
hopes that by means of conquests in Sicily, Athens might become
mistress of all Greece. But this is there put as an alternative and
as a favorable possibility, is noticed only in one place, without
expansion or amplification, and shows that the speaker did not reckon
upon finding any such expectations prevalent among his hearers.
Alkibiadês could not have ventured to promise, in his discourse
at Athens, the results which he afterwards talked of at Sparta as
having been actually contemplated,—Sicily, Italy, Carthage, Iberian
mercenaries, etc., all ending in a blockading fleet large enough to
gird round Peloponnesus.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360"
class="fnanchor">[360]</a> Had he put forth such promises, the charge
of juvenile folly which Nikias urged against him would probably have
been believed by every one. His speech at Sparta, though it has
passed with some as a fragment of true Grecian<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_242">[p. 242]</span> history, is in truth little better
than a gigantic romance dressed up to alarm his audience.<a
id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>Intended for this purpose, it was eminently suitable and
effective. The Lacedæmonians had already been partly moved by the
representations from Corinth and Syracuse, and were even prepared
to send envoys to the latter place with encouragement to hold out
against Athens. But the Peace of Nikias and the alliance succeeding
it, still subsisted between Athens and Sparta. It had indeed been
partially and indirectly violated in many ways, but both the
contracting parties still considered it as subsisting, nor would
either of them yet consent to break their oaths openly and avowedly.
For this reason—as well as from the distance of Sicily, great even
in the estimation of the more nautical Athenians—the ephors could
not yet make up their minds to despatch thither any positive aid.
It was exactly in this point of hesitation between the will and the
deed that the energetic and vindictive exile from Athens found them.
His flaming picture of the danger impending,—brought home to their
own doors, and appearing to proceed from the best informed of all
witnesses,—overcame their reluctance at once; while he at the same
time pointed out the precise steps whereby their interference would
be rendered of most avail. The transfer of Alkibiadês to Sparta
thus reverses the superiority of force between the two contending
chiefs of Greece: “Momentumque fuit mutatus Curio rerum.”<a
id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> He
had not yet shown his power of doing his country good, as we shall
find him hereafter engaged, during the later years of the war: his
first achievements were but too successful in doing her harm.</p>

<p>The Lacedæmonians forthwith resolved to send an auxiliary force
to Syracuse. But as this could not be done before the spring, they
nominated Gylippus commander, directing him to proceed thither
without delay, and to take counsel with the Corinthians for
operations as speedily as the case admitted.<a id="FNanchor_363"
href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> We do not know that
Gylippus had as yet given any positive evidence of that consummate
skill and activity which we shall presently be called upon to
describe. He was probably chosen on account<span class="pagenum"

the circumstances of the Italian and Sicilian Greeks; since his
father Kleandridas, after having been banished from Sparta fourteen

had been domiciliated as a citizen at Thurii.<a id="FNanchor_364"

Corinthians to send immediately two triremes for him to Asinê, in the

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span>
Athenian troops at Katana, probably tired of inaction, were put
in motion in the early spring, even before the arrival of the
reinforcements from Athens, and sailed to the deserted walls of
Megara, not far from Syracuse, which the Syracusans had recently
garrisoned. Having in vain attacked the Syracusan garrison, and
laid waste the neighboring fields, they reëmbarked, landed again
for similar purposes at the mouth of the river Terias, and then,
after an insignificant skirmish, returned to Katana. An expedition
into the interior of the island procured for them the alliance of
the Sikel town of Kentoripa; and the cavalry being now arrived from
Athens, they prepared for operations against Syracuse. Nikias had
received from Athens two hundred and fifty horsemen fully equipped,
for whom horses were to be procured in Sicily,<a id="FNanchor_365"
href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> thirty horse-bowmen,
and three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[p. 244]</span> hundred
talents in money. He was not long in furnishing them with horses
from Egesta and Katana, from which cities he also received some
farther cavalry, so that he was presently able to muster six hundred
and fifty cavalry in all.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366"
class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>Even before this cavalry could be mounted, Nikias made his first
approach to Syracuse. For the Syracusan generals on their side,
apprized of the arrival of the reinforcement from Athens, and aware
that besieging operations were on the point of being commenced, now
thought it necessary to take the precaution of occupying and guarding
the roads of access to the high ground of Epipolæ which overhung
their outer city.</p>

<p>Syracuse consisted at this time of two parts, an inner and outer
city. The former was comprised in the island of Ortygia, the original
settlement founded by Archias, and within which the modern city is
at this moment included: the latter or outer city, afterwards known
by the name of Achradina, occupied the high ground of the peninsula
north of Ortygia, but does not seem to have joined the inner city, or
to have been comprised in the same fortification. This outer city was
defended, on the north and east, by the sea, with rocks presenting
great difficulties of landing, and by a sea-wall; so that on these
sides it was out of the reach of attack. Its wall on the land-side,
beginning from the sea somewhat eastward of the entrance of the cleft
now called Santa Bonagia, or Panagia, ran in a direction westward of
south as far as the termination of the high ground of Achradina, and
then turned eastward along the stone quarries now known as those of
the Capucins and Novanteris, where the ground is in part so steep,
that probably little fortification was needed. This fortified high
land of Achradina thus constituted the outer city; while the lower
ground, situated between it and the inner city, or Ortygia, seems at
this time not to have been included in the fortifications of either,
but was employed (and probably had been employed even from the first
settlement in the island), partly for religious processions, games,
and other multitudinous ceremonies; partly for the burial of the
dead, which, according to invariable Grecian custom, was performed
without the walls of the city. Extensive catacombs yet remain to mark
the length of time during which this ancient Nekropolis served its
purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[p. 245]</span></p>

<p>To the northwest of the outer city wall, in the direction of the
port called Trogilus, stood an unfortified suburb which afterwards
became enlarged into the distinct walled town of Tychê. West of
the southern part of the same outer city wall, nearly southwest
of the outer city itself, stood another suburb, afterwards known
and fortified as Neapolis, but deriving its name, in the year 415
<small>B.C.</small>, from having within it the statue
and consecrated ground of Apollo Temenitês,<a id="FNanchor_367"
href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> which stood a little
way up on the ascent of the hill of Epipolæ, and stretching from
thence down southward in the direction of the Great Harbor. Between
these two suburbs lay a broad open space, the ground rising in
gradual acclivity from Achradina to the westward, and diminishing
in breadth as it rose higher, until at length it ended in a small
conical mound, called in modern times the Belvedere. This acclivity
formed the eastern ascent of the long ridge of high ground called
Epipolæ. It was a triangle upon an inclined plane, of which Achradina
was the base: to the north as well as to the south, it was suddenly
broken off by lines of limestone cliff (forming the sides of the
triangle), about fifteen or twenty feet high, and quite precipitous,
except in some few openings made for convenient ascent. From the
western point or apex of the triangle, the descent was easy and
gradual—excepting two or three special mounds, or cliffs—towards the
city, the interior of which was visible from this outer slope.</p>

<p>According to the warfare of that time, Nikias could only take
Syracuse by building a wall of circumvallation so as to cut off
its supplies by land, and at the same time blockading it by sea.
Now looking at the inner and outer city as above described, at the
moment when he first reached Sicily, we see that—after defeating
the Syracusans and driving them within their walls, which would be
of course the first part of the process—he might have carried his
blockading wall in a direction nearly southerly from the innermost
point of the cleft of Santa Bonagia, between the city wall and the
Temenitês so as to reach the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[p.
246]</span> Great Harbor at a spot not far westward of the junction
of Ortygia with the main land. Or he might have landed in the Great
Harbor, and executed the same wall, beginning from the opposite
end. Or he might have preferred to construct two blockading walls,
one for each city separately: a short wall would have sufficed in
front of the isthmus joining Ortygia, while a separate wall might
have been carried to shut up the outer city, across the unfortified
space constituting the Nekropolis, so as to end not in the Great
Harbor, but in the coast of the Nekropolis opposite to Ortygia. Such
were the possibilities of the case at the time when Nikias first
reached Rhegium. But during the many months of inaction which he had
allowed, the Syracusans had barred out both these possibilities, and
had greatly augmented the difficulties of his intended enterprise.
They had constructed a new wall, covering both their inner and
their outer city,—stretching across the whole front which faced
the slope of Epipolæ, from the Great Harbor to the opposite sea
near Santa Bonagia,—and expanding westward so as to include within
it the statue and consecrated ground of Apollo Temenitês, with
the cliff near adjoining to it known by the name of the Temenite
Cliff. This was done for the express purpose of lengthening the line
indispensable for the besiegers to make their wall a good blockade.<a
id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>
After it was finished, Nikias could not begin his blockade from the
side of the Great Harbor, since he would have been obstructed by the
precipitous southern cliff of Epipolæ. He was under the necessity of
beginning his wall from a portion of the higher ground of Epipolæ,
and of carrying it both along a greater space and higher up on the
slope, until he touched the Great Harbor at a point farther removed
from Ortygia.</p>

<p>Syracuse having thus become assailable only from the side of
Epipolæ, the necessity so created for carrying on operations much
higher up on the slope, gave to the summit of that eminence a
greater importance than it had before possessed. Nikias, doubtless
furnished with good local information by the exiles, seems to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[p. 247]</span> have made this
discovery earlier than the Syracusan generals, who—having been
occupied in augmenting their defences on another point, where they
were yet more vulnerable—did not make it until immediately before
the opening of the spring campaign. It was at that critical moment
that they proclaimed a full muster, for break of day, in the low
mead on the left bank of the Anapus. After an inspection of arms,
and probably final distribution of forces for the approaching
struggle, a chosen regiment of six hundred hoplites was placed under
the orders of an Andrian exile named Diomilus, in order to act as
garrison of Epipolæ, as well as to be in constant readiness wherever
they might be wanted.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369"
class="fnanchor">[369]</a> These men were intended to occupy the
strong ground on the summit of the hill, and thus obstruct all the
various approaches to it, seemingly not many in number, and all
narrow.</p>

<p>But before they had yet left their muster, to march to the
summit, intelligence reached them that the Athenians were already
in possession of it. Nikias and Lamachus, putting their troops
on board at Katana, had sailed during the preceding night to a
landing-place not far from a place called Leon, or the Lion, which
was only six or seven furlongs from Epipolæ, and seems to have
lain between Megara and the peninsula of Thapsus. They here landed
their hoplites, and placed their fleet in safety under cover of a
palisade across the narrow isthmus of Thapsus, before day and before
the Syracusans had any intimation of their arrival. Their hoplites
immediately moved forward with rapid step to ascend Epipolæ, mounting
seemingly from the northeast, by the side towards Megara and farthest
removed from Syracuse; so that they first reached the summit called
Euryalus, near the apex of the triangle above described. From
hence they commanded the slope of Epipolæ beneath them, and the
town of Syracuse to the eastward. They were presently attacked by
the Syracusans, who broke up their muster in the mead as soon as
they heard the news. But as the road by which they had to march,
approaching Euryalus from the southwest, was circuitous, and hardly
less than three English miles in length, they had the mortification
of seeing that the Athenians were already masters of the position;
and when they hastened up to retake it, the rapid pace had so<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[p. 248]</span> disordered their ranks,
that the Athenians attacked them at great advantage, besides having
the higher ground. The Syracusans were driven back to their city
with loss, Diomilus with half his regiment being slain; while the
Athenians remained masters of the high ground of Euryalus, as well
as of the upper portion of the slope of Epipolæ.<a id="FNanchor_370"
href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>This was a most important advantage; indeed, seemingly essential
to the successful prosecution of the siege. It was gained by a plan
both well laid and well executed, grounded upon the omission of the
Syracusans to occupy a post of which they did not at first perceive
the importance, and which in fact only acquired its preëminent
importance from the new enlargement made by the Syracusans in
their fortifications. To that extent, therefore, it depended upon
a favorable accident which could not have been reasonably expected
to occur. The capture of Syracuse was certain, upon the supposition
that the attack and siege of the city had been commenced on the
first arrival of the Athenians in the island, without giving time
for any improvement in its defensibility. But the moment such delay
was allowed, success ceased to be certain, depending more or less
upon this favorable turn of accident. The Syracusans actually did
a great deal to create additional difficulty to the besiegers, and
might have done more, especially in regard to the occupation of
the high ground above Epipolæ. Had they taken this precaution, the
effective prosecution of the siege would have been rendered extremely
difficult, if not completely frustrated.</p>

<p>On the next morning, Nikias and Lamachus marched their army down
the slope of Epipolæ near to the Syracusan walls, and offered battle,
which the enemy did not accept. They then withdrew the Athenian
troops; after which their first operation was to construct a fort on
the high ground called Labdalum, near the western end of the upper
northern cliffs bordering Epipolæ, on the brink of the cliff, and
looking northward towards Megara. This was intended as a place of
security wherein both treasures and stores might be deposited, so as
to leave the army unencumbered in its motions. The Athenian cavalry
being now completed by the new arrivals from Egesta, Nikias descended
from Labda<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[p. 249]</span>lum
to a new position called Sykê, lower down on Epipolæ, seemingly
about midway between the northern and southern cliffs. He here
constructed, with as much rapidity as possible, a walled inclosure,
called the Circle, intended as a centre from whence the projected
wall of circumvallation was to start northward towards the sea at
Trogilus, southward towards the Great Harbor. This Circle appears
to have covered a considerable space, and was farther protected by
an outwork in front covering an area of one thousand square feet.<a
id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
Astounded at the rapidity with which the Athenians executed
this construction,<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372"
class="fnanchor">[372]</a> the Syracusans marched their forces out,
and prepared to give battle in order to interrupt it. But when the
Athenians, relinquishing the work, drew up on their side in battle
order, the Syracusan generals were so struck with their manifest
superiority in soldier-like array, as compared with the disorderly
trim of their own ranks, that they withdrew their soldiers back into
the city without venturing to engage; merely leaving a body of horse
to harass the operations of the besiegers, and constrain them to keep
in masses. The newly-acquired Athenian cavalry, however, were here
brought for the first time into effective combat. With the aid of one
tribe of their own hoplites, they charged the Syracusan horse, drove
them off with some loss, and erected their trophy. This is the only
occasion on which we read of the Athenian cavalry being brought into
conflict; though Nikias had made the absence of cavalry the great
reason for his prolonged inaction.</p>

<p>Interruption being thus checked, Nikias continued his blockading
operations; first completing the Circle,<a id="FNanchor_373"
href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> then beginning<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[p. 250]</span> his wall of
circumvallation in a northerly direction from the Circle towards
Trogilus: for which purpose a portion of his forces were employed in
bringing stones and wood, and depositing them in proper places along
the intended line. So strongly did Hermokratês feel the inferiority
of the Syracusan hoplites in the field, that he discouraged any
fresh general action, and proposed to construct a counter-wall,
or cross-wall, traversing the space along which the Athenian
circumvallation must necessarily be continued so as to impede its
farther progress. A tenable counter-wall, if they could get time to
carry it sufficiently far to a defensible terminus, would completely
defeat the intent of the besiegers: but even if Nikias should
interrupt the work by his attacks, the Syracusans calculated on
being able to provide a sufficient force to repel them, during the
short time necessary for hastily constructing the palisade, or front
outwork. Such palisade would serve them as a temporary defence, while
they finished the more elaborate cross-wall behind it, and would,
even at the worst, compel Nikias to suspend all his proceedings
and employ his whole force to dislodge them.<a id="FNanchor_374"
href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[p. 251]</span></p>

<p>Accordingly, they took their start from the postern-gate near
the grove of Apollo Temenitês; a gate in the new wall, erected four
or five months before, to enlarge the fortified space of the city.
From this point, which was lower down on the slope of Epipolæ than
the Athenian circle, they carried their palisade and counter-wall up
the slope, in a direction calculated to intersect the intended line
of hostile circumvallation southward of the Circle. The nautical
population from Ortygia could be employed in this enterprise, since
the city was still completely undisturbed by sea, and mistress of the
great harbor, the Athenian fleet not having yet moved from Thapsus.
Besides this active crowd of workmen, the sacred olive-trees in the
Temenite grove were cut down to serve as materials; and by such
efforts the work was presently finished to a sufficient distance for
traversing and intercepting the blockading wall intended to come
southward from the Circle. It seems to have terminated at the brink
of the precipitous southern cliff of Epipolæ, which prevented the
Athenians from turning it and attacking it in flank; while it was
defended in front by a stockade and topped with wooden towers for
discharge of missiles. One tribe of hoplites was left to defend it,
while the crowd of Syracusans who had either been employed on the
work or on guard, returned back to the city.</p>

<p>During all this process, Nikias had not thought it prudent
to interrupt them.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375"
class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Employed as he seems to have been on the
Circle, and on the wall branching out from his Circle northward,
he was unwilling to march across the slope of Epipolæ to attack
them with half his forces, leaving his own rear exposed to attack
from the numerous Syracusans in the city, and his own Circle<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[p. 252]</span> only partially
guarded. Moreover, by such delay, he was enabled to prosecute
his own part of the circumvallation without hindrance, and to
watch for an opportunity of assaulting the new counter-wall with
advantage. Such an opportunity soon occurred, just at the time when
he had accomplished the farther important object of destroying
the aqueducts, which supplied the city, partially at least, with
water for drinking. The Syracusans appear to have been filled with
confidence, both by the completion of their counter-wall, which
seemed an effective bar to the besiegers, and by his inaction. The
tribe left on guard presently began to relax in their vigilance:
instead of occupying the wall, tents were erected behind it to
shelter them from the midday sun; while some even permitted
themselves to take repose during that hour within the city walls.
Such negligence did not escape the Athenian generals, who silently
prepared an assault for midday. Three hundred chosen hoplites,
with some light troops clothed in panoplies for the occasion,
were instructed to sally out suddenly and run across straight to
attack the stockade and counter-wall; while the main Athenian force
marched in two divisions under Nikias and Lamachus; half towards
the city walls, to prevent any succor from coming out of the gates,
half towards the Temenite postern-gate from whence the stockade
and cross-wall commenced. The rapid forward movement of the chosen
three hundred was crowned with full success. They captured both the
stockade and the counter-wall, feebly defended by its guards; who,
taken by surprise, abandoned their post and fled along behind their
wall to enter the city by the Temenite postern-gate. Before all of
them could get in, however, both the pursuing three hundred, and the
Athenian division which marched straight to that point, had partially
come up with them: so that some of these assailants even forced
their way along with them through the gate into the interior of the
Temenite city wall. Here, however, the Syracusan strength within
was too much for them: these foremost Athenians and Argeians were
thrust out again with loss. But the general movement of the Athenians
had been completely triumphant. They pulled down the counter-wall,
plucked up the palisade, and carried the materials away for the use
of their own circumvallation.</p>

<p>As the recent Syracusan counter-work had been carried to the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[p. 253]</span> brink of the southern
cliff, which rendered it unassailable in flank, Nikias was warned of
the necessity of becoming master of this cliff, so as to deprive them
of this resource in future. Accordingly, without staying to finish
his blockading wall, regularly and continuously from the Circle
southward, across the slope of Epipolæ, he left the Circle under a
guard, and marched across at once to take possession of the southern
cliff, at the point where the blockading wall was intended to reach
it. This point of the southern cliff he immediately fortified as
a defensive position, whereby he accomplished two objects. First,
he prevented the Syracusans from again employing the cliff as
a flank defence for a second counter-wall.<a id="FNanchor_376"
href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> Next, he acquired
the means of providing a safe and easy road of communication between
the high ground of Epipolæ and the low marshy ground beneath,
which divided Epipolæ from the Great Harbor, and across which the
Athenian wall of circumvallation must necessarily be presently<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[p. 254]</span> carried. As his troops
would have to carry on simultaneous operations, partly on the high
ground above, partly on the low ground beneath, he could not allow
them to be separated from each other by a precipitous cliff which
would prevent ready mutual assistance. The intermediate space between
the Circle and the fortified point of the cliff, was for the time
left with an unfinished wall, with the intention of coming back to
it, as was in fact afterwards done, and this portion of wall was in
the end completed. The Circle, though isolated, was strong enough
for the time to maintain itself against attack, and was adequately
garrisoned.</p>

<p>By this new movement, the Syracusans were debarred from carrying
a second counter-wall on the same side of Epipolæ, since the enemy
were masters of the terminating cliff on the southern side of the
slope. They now turned their operations to the lower ground or marsh
between the southern cliff of the Epipolæ and the Great Harbor;
being as yet free on that side, since the Athenian fleet was still
at Thapsus. Across that marsh—and seemingly as far as the river
Anapus, to serve as a flank barrier—they resolved to carry a palisade
work with a ditch, so as to intersect the line which the Athenians
must next pursue in completing the southernmost portion of their
circumvallation. They so pressed the prosecution of this new cross
palisade, beginning from the lower portion of their own city walls,
and stretching in a southwesterly direction across the low ground
as far as the river Anapus, that, by the time the new Athenian
fortification on the cliff was completed, the new Syracusan obstacle
was completed also, and a stockade with a ditch seemed to shut out
the besiegers from reaching the Great Harbor.</p>

<p>Lamachus overcame the difficulty before him with ability and
bravery. Descending unexpectedly, one morning before daybreak, from
his fort on the cliff of Epipolæ into the low ground beneath,—and
providing his troops with planks and broad gates to bridge over the
marsh where it was scarcely passable,—he contrived to reach and
surprise the palisade with the first dawn of morning. Orders were
at the same time given for the Athenian fleet to sail round from
Thapsus into the Great Harbor, so as to divert the attention of the
enemy, and get on the rear of the new palisade work. But before the
fleet could arrive, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[p.
255]</span> palisade and ditch had been carried, and its defenders
driven off. A large Syracusan force came out from the city to sustain
them, and retake it, so that a general action now ensued, in the
low ground between the cliff of Epipolæ, the harbor, and the river
Anapus. The superior discipline of the Athenians proved successful:
the Syracusans were defeated and driven back on all sides, so that
their right wing fled into the city, and their left (including the
larger portion of their best force, the horsemen), along the banks
of the river Anapus, to reach the bridge. Flushed with victory, the
Athenians hoped to cut them off from this retreat, and a chosen
body of three hundred hoplites ran fast in hopes of getting to the
bridge first. In this hasty movement they fell into disorder, so
that the Syracusan cavalry turned upon them, put them to flight,
and threw them back upon the Athenian right wing, to which the
fugitives communicated their own panic and disorder. The fate of the
battle appeared to be turning against the Athenians, when Lamachus,
who was on the left wing, hastened to their aid with the Argeian
hoplites and as many bowmen as he could collect. His ardor carried
him incautiously forward, so that he crossed a ditch with very few
followers, before the remaining troops could follow him. He was
here attacked and slain,<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377"
class="fnanchor">[377]</a> in single combat with a horseman named
Kallikratês: but the Syracusans were driven back when his soldiers
came up, and had only just time to snatch and carry off his dead
body, with which they crossed the bridge and retreated behind the
Anapus. The rapid movement of this gallant officer was thus crowned
with complete success, restoring the victory to his own right
wing: a victory dearly purchased by the forfeit of his own life.<a
id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the visible disorder and temporary flight of the
Athenian right wing, and the withdrawal of Lamachus from the left
to reinforce it, imparted fresh courage to the Syracusan right,
which had fled into the town. They again came forth to renew the
contest; while their generals attempted a diversion by sending out
a detachment from the northwestern gates of the city to attack
the Athenian circle on the mid-slope of Epipolæ. As this<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[p. 256]</span> Circle lay completely
apart and at considerable distance from the battle, they hoped to
find the garrison unprepared for attack, and thus to carry it by
surprise. Their manœuvre, bold and well-timed, was on the point of
succeeding. They carried with little difficulty the covering outwork
in front, and the Circle itself, probably stripped of part of its
garrison to reinforce the combatants in the lower ground, was only
saved by the presence of mind and resource of Nikias, who was lying
ill within it. He directed the attendants immediately to set fire to
a quantity of wood which lay, together with the battering engines of
the army, in front of the circle-wall, so that the flames prevented
all farther advance on the part of the assailants, and forced them
to retreat. The same flames also served as a signal to the Athenians
engaged in the battle beneath, who immediately sent reinforcements
to the relief of their general; while at the same time the Athenian
fleet, just arrived from Thapsus, was seen sailing into the Great
Harbor. This last event, threatening the Syracusans on a new side,
drew off their whole attention to the defence of their city, so
that both their combatants from the field and their detachment from
the Circle were brought back within the walls.<a id="FNanchor_379"
href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>Had the recent attempt on the Circle succeeded, carrying with
it the death or capture of Nikias, and combined with the death
of Lamachus in the field on that same day, it would have greatly
brightened the prospects of the Syracusans, and might even have
arrested the farther progress of the siege, from the want of an
authorized commander. But in spite of such imminent hazard, the
actual result of the day left the Athenians completely victorious,
and the Syracusans more discouraged than ever. What materially
contributed to their discouragement, was, the recent entrance of the
Athenian fleet into the Great Harbor, wherein it was henceforward
permanently established, in coöperation with the army in a station
near the left bank of the Anapus.</p>

<p>Both the army and the fleet now began to occupy themselves
seriously with the construction of the southernmost part of the
wall of circumvallation; beginning immediately below the Athenian
fortified point of descent from the southern cliff of Epipolæ,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[p. 257]</span> and stretching across
the lower marshy ground to the Great Harbor. The distance between
these two extreme points was about eight stadia or nearly an English
mile: the wall was double, with gates, and probably towers, at
suitable intervals, inclosing a space of considerable breadth,
doubtless roofed over in part, since it served afterwards, with the
help of the adjoining citadel on the cliff, as shelter and defence
for the whole Athenian army. The Syracusans could not interrupt this
process, nor could they undertake a new counter-wall up the mid-slope
of Epipolæ, without coming out to fight a general battle, which they
did not feel competent to do. Of course the Circle had now been put
into condition to defy a second surprise.</p>

<p>But not only were they thus compelled to look on without
hindering the blockading wall towards the Harbor. It was now, for
the first time, that they began to taste the real restraints and
privations of a siege.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380"
class="fnanchor">[380]</a> Down to this moment, their communication
with the Anapus and the country beyond, as well as with all sides
of the Great Harbor, had been open and unimpeded; whereas now, the
arrival of the Athenian fleet, and the change of position of the
Athenian army, had cut them off from both,<a id="FNanchor_381"
href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> so that little or no
fresh supplies of provision could reach them except at the hazard
of capture from the hostile ships. On the side of Thapsus, where
the northern cliff of Epipolæ affords only two or three practicable
passages of ascent, they had before been blocked up by the Athenian
army and fleet; and a portion of the fleet seems even now to have
been left at Thapsus: so that nothing now remained open, except a
portion, especially the northern portion, of the slope of Epipolæ.
Of this outlet the besieged, especially their numerous cavalry,
doubtless availed themselves, for the purpose of excursions and of
bringing in supplies. But it was both longer and more circuitous for
such purposes than the plain near the Great Harbor and the Helôrine
road: moreover, it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[p.
258]</span> to pass by the high and narrow pass of Euryâlus, and
might thus be rendered unavailable to the besieged, whenever Nikias
thought fit to occupy and fortify that position. Unfortunately for
himself and his army, he omitted this easy but capital precaution,
even at the moment when he must have known Gylippus to be
approaching.</p>

<p>In regard to the works actually undertaken, the order followed
by Nikias and Lamachus can be satisfactorily explained. Having
established their fortified post on the centre of the slope of
Epipolæ, they were in condition to combat opposition and attack any
counter-wall on whichever side the enemy might erect it. Commencing
in the first place the execution of the northern portion of the
blockading line, they soon desist from this and turn their attention
to the southern portion, because it was here that the Syracusans
carried their two first counter-works. In attacking the second
counter-work of the Syracusans, across the marsh to the Anapus,
they chose a suitable moment for bringing the main fleet round from
Thapsus into the Great Harbor, with a view to its coöperation. After
clearing the lower ground, they probably deemed it advisable, in
order to establish a safe and easy communication with their fleet,
that the double wall across the marsh, from Epipolæ to the Harbor,
should stand next for execution; for which there was this farther
reason, that they thereby blocked up the most convenient exit and
channel of supply for Syracuse. There are thus plausible reasons
assignable why the northern portion of the line of blockade, from
the Athenian camp on Epipolæ to the sea at Trogilus, was left to
the last, and was found open, at least the greater part of it, by
Gylippus.</p>

<p>While the Syracusans thus began to despair of their situation,
the prospects of the Athenians were better than ever, promising
certain and not very distant triumph. The reports circulating
through the neighboring cities all represented them as in the full
tide of success, so that many Sikel tribes, hitherto wavering, came
in to tender their alliance, while three armed pentekonters also
arrived from the Tyrrhenian coast. Moreover, abundant supplies
were furnished from the Italian Greeks generally. Nikias, now
sole commander since the death of Lamachus, had even the glory of
receiving and discussing proposals from Syracuse for capitulation,
a necessity which was openly and abundantly canvassed<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[p. 259]</span> within the city
itself. The ill-success of Hermokratês and his colleagues had caused
them to be recently displaced from their functions as generals, to
which Herakleidês, Euklês, and Tellias, were appointed. But this
change did not give them confidence to hazard a fresh battle, while
the temper of the city, during such period of forced inaction,
was melancholy in the extreme. Though several propositions for
surrender, perhaps unofficial, yet seemingly sincere, were made to
Nikias, nothing definitive could be agreed upon as to the terms.<a
id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>
Had the Syracusan government been oligarchical, the present distress
would have exhibited a large body of malcontents upon whom he could
have worked with advantage; but the democratical character of the
government maintained union at home in this trying emergency.<a
id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>We must take particular note of these propositions in order
to understand the conduct of Nikias during the present critical
interval. He had been from the beginning in secret correspondence
with a party in Syracuse;<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384"
class="fnanchor">[384]</a> who, though neither numerous nor powerful
in themselves, were now doubtless both more active and more
influential than ever they had been before. From them he received
constant and not unreasonable assurances that the city was on the
point of surrendering, and could not possibly hold out. And as the
tone of opinion without, as well as within, conspired to raise such
an impression in his mind, so he suffered himself to be betrayed
into a fatal languor and security as to the farther prosecution of
the besieging operations. The injurious consequences of the death
of Lamachus now became evident. From the time of the departure from
Katana down to the battle in which that gallant officer perished,—a
period seemingly of about three months, from about March to June 414
<small>B.C.</small>,—the operations of the siege had been
conducted with great vigor as well as unremitting perseverance, and
the building-work, especially, had been so rapidly executed as to
fill the Syracusans with amazement. But so soon as Nikias is left
sole commander, this vigorous march disappears and is exchanged
for slackness and apathy. The wall across the low ground near the
harbor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[p. 260]</span> might
have been expected to proceed more rapidly, because the Athenian
position generally was much stronger, the chance of opposition from
the Syracusans was much lessened, and the fleet had been brought into
the Great Harbor to coöperate. Yet in fact it seems to have proceeded
more slowly; Nikias builds it at first as a double wall, though it
would have been practicable to complete the whole line of blockade
with a single wall before the arrival of Gylippus, and afterwards, if
necessary, to have doubled it either wholly or partially, instead of
employing so much time in completing this one portion that Gylippus
arrived before it was finished, scarcely less than two months after
the death of Lamachus. Both the besiegers and their commander now
seem to consider success as certain, without any chance of effective
interruption from within, still less from without; so that they may
take their time over the work, without caring whether the ultimate
consummation comes a month sooner or later.</p>

<p>Though such was the present temper of the Athenian troops, Nikias
could doubtless have spurred them on and accelerated the operations,
had he himself been convinced of the necessity of doing so. Hitherto,
we have seen him always overrating the gloomy contingencies of the
future, and disposed to calculate as if the worst was to happen which
possibly could happen. But a great part of what passes for caution in
his character, was in fact backwardness and inertia of temperament,
aggravated by the melancholy addition of a painful internal
complaint. If he wasted in indolence the first six months after his
arrival in Sicily, and turned to inadequate account the present two
months of triumphant position before Syracuse, both these mistakes
arose from the same cause; from reluctance to act except under the
pressure and stimulus of some obvious necessity. Accordingly, he was
always behindhand with events; but when necessity became terrible,
so as to subdue the energies of other men, then did he come forward
and display unwonted vigor, as we shall see in the following chapter.
But now, relieved from all urgency of apparent danger, and misled
by the delusive hopes held out through his correspondence in the
town, combined with the atmosphere of success which exhilarated his
own armament, Nikias fancied the surrender of Syracuse inevitable,
and became, for one brief moment preceding his calamitous end, not
merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[p. 261]</span> sanguine,
but even careless and presumptuous in the extreme. Nothing short of
this presumption could have let in his destroying enemy, Gylippus.<a
id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>That officer—named by the Lacedæmonians commander in Sicily, at
the winter-meeting which Alkibiadês had addressed at Sparta—had
employed himself in getting together forces for the purpose of the
expedition. But the Lacedæmonians, though so far stimulated by the
representations of the Athenian exile as to promise aid, were not
forward to perform the promise. Even the Corinthians, decidedly the
most hearty of all in behalf of Syracuse, were yet so tardy, that in
the month of June, Gylippus was still at Leukas, with his armament
not quite ready to sail. To embark in a squadron for Sicily, against
the numerous and excellent Athenian fleet now acting there, was a
service not tempting to any one, and demanding both personal daring
and devotion. Moreover, every vessel from Sicily, between March
and June 414 <small>B.C.</small>, brought intelligence
of progressive success on the part of Nikias and Lamachus, thus
rendering the prospects of Corinthian auxiliaries still more
discouraging.</p>

<p>At length, in the month of June, arrived the news of that defeat
of the Syracusans wherein Lamachus was slain, and of its important
consequences in forwarding the operations of the besiegers. Great
as those consequences were, they were still farther exaggerated by
report. It was confidently affirmed, by messenger after messenger,
that the wall of circumvallation had been completed, and that
Syracuse was now invested on all sides.<a id="FNanchor_386"
href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Both Gylippus and
the Corinthians were so far misled as to believe this to be the
fact, and despaired, in consequence, of being able to render any
effective aid against the Athenians in Sicily. But as there still
remained hopes of being able to preserve the Greek cities in Italy,
Gylippus thought it important to pass over thither at once with his
own little squadron of four sail, two Lacedæ<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_262">[p. 262]</span>monians and two Corinthians, and the
Corinthian captain Pythên; leaving the Corinthian main squadron
to follow as soon as it was ready. Intending then to act only in
Italy, Gylippus did not fear falling in with the Athenian fleet.
He first sailed to Tarentum, friendly and warm in his cause. From
hence he undertook a visit to Thurii, where his father Kleandridas,
exiled from Sparta, had formerly resided as citizen. After trying
to profit by this opening for the purpose of gaining the Thurians,
and finding nothing but refusal, he passed on farther southward,
until he came opposite to the Terinæan gulf near the southeastern
cape of Italy. Here a violent gust of wind off the land overtook
him, exposed his vessels to the greatest dangers, and drove him
out to sea, until at length, standing in a northerly direction,
he was fortunate enough to find shelter again at Tarentum.<a
id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>
But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[p. 263]</span> such was the
damage which his ships had sustained, that he was forced to remain
here while they were hauled ashore and refitted.<a id="FNanchor_388"
href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>So untoward a delay threatened to intercept altogether his farther
progress. For the Thurians had sent intimation of his visit as well
as of the number of his vessels, to Nikias at Syracuse; treating with
contempt the idea of four triremes coming to attack the powerful
Athenian fleet. In the present sanguine phase of his character,
Nikias sympathized with the flattering tenor of the message, and
overlooked the gravity of the fact announced. He despised Gylippus
as a mere privateer, nor would he even take the precaution of
sending four ships from his numerous fleet to watch and intercept
the new-comer. Accordingly Gylippus, after having refitted his ships
at Tarentum, advanced southward along the coast without opposition
to the Epizephyrian Lokri. Here he first learned, to his great
satisfaction, that Syracuse was not yet so completely blockaded but
that an army might still reach and relieve it from the interior,
entering it by the Euryâlus and the heights of Epipolæ. Having
deliberated whether he should take the chance of running his ships
into the harbor of Syracuse, despite the watch of the Athenian fleet,
or whether he should sail through the strait of Messina to Himera at
the north of Sicily, and from thence levy an army to cross the island
and relieve Syracuse by land, he resolved on the latter course,
and passed forthwith through the strait, which he found altogether
unguarded. After touching both at Rhegium and Messênê, he arrived
safely at Himera. Even at Rhegium, there was no Athenian naval force;
though Nikias had, indeed, sent thither four Athenian triremes, after
he had been apprized that Gylippus had reached Lokri, rather from
excess of precaution, than because he thought it necessary. But this
Athenian squadron reached Rhegium too late: Gylippus had already
passed the strait; and fortune, smiting his enemy with blindness,
landed him unopposed on the fatal soil of Sicily.</p>

<p>The blindness of Nikias would indeed appear unaccountable, were
it not that we shall have worse yet to recount. To appreciate
his misjudgment fully, and to be sensible that we are not<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[p. 264]</span> making him responsible
for results which could not have been foreseen, we have only to
turn back to what had been said six months before by the exile
Alkibiadês at Sparta: “Send forthwith an army to Sicily (he exhorted
the Lacedæmonians); <i>but send at the same time, what will be yet
more valuable than an army, a Spartan to take the supreme command</i>.”
It was in fulfilment of this recommendation, the wisdom of which
will abundantly appear, that Gylippus had been appointed. And had
he even reached Syracuse alone in a fishing-boat, the effect of his
presence, carrying the great name of Sparta, and full assurance of
Spartan intervention to come, not to mention his great personal
ability, would have sufficed to give new life to the besieged.
Yet Nikias—having, through a lucky accident, timely notice of his
approach, when a squadron of four ships would have prevented his
reaching the island—disdains even this most easy precaution, and
neglects him as a freebooter of no significance. Such neglect too is
the more surprising, since the well-known philo-Laconian tendencies
of Nikias would have led us to expect, that he would overvalue rather
than undervalue the imposing ascendency of the Spartan name.</p>

<p>Gylippus, on arriving at Himera, as commander named by Sparta, and
announcing himself as forerunner of Peloponnesian reinforcements, met
with a hearty welcome. The Himeræans agreed to aid him with a body
of hoplites, and to furnish panoplies for the seamen in his vessels.
On sending to Selinus, Gela, and some of the Sikel tribes in the
interior, he received equally favorable assurances; so that he was
enabled in no very long time to get together a respectable force.
The interest of Athens among the Sikels had been recently weakened
by the death of one of her most active partisans, the Sikel prince
Archonidês, a circumstance which both enabled Gylippus to obtain
more of their aid, and facilitated his march across the island. He
was enabled to undertake this inland march from Himera to Syracuse
at the head of seven hundred hoplites from his own vessels, seamen
and epibatæ taken together; one thousand hoplites and light troops,
with one hundred horse, from Himera, some horse and light troops
from Selinus and Gela, and one thousand Sikels.<a id="FNanchor_389"
href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> With<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[p. 265]</span> these forces, some of
whom joined him on the march, he reached Euryâlus and the heights of
Epipolæ above Syracuse, assaulting and capturing the Sikel fort of
Ietæ in his way, but without experiencing any other opposition.</p>

<p>His arrival was all but too late, and might have been actually
too late, had not the Corinthian admiral Goggylus got to Syracuse a
little before him. The Corinthian fleet of twelve triremes, under
Erasinidês—having started from Leukas later than Gylippus, but as
soon as it was ready—was now on its way to Syracuse. But Goggylus
had been detained at Leukas by some accident, so that he did not
depart until after all the rest. Yet he reached Syracuse the soonest;
probably striking a straighter course across the sea, and favored
by weather. He got safely into the harbor of Syracuse, escaping
the Athenian guardships, whose watch doubtless partook of the
general negligence of the besieging operations.<a id="FNanchor_390"
href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>The arrival of Goggylus at that moment was an accident of
unspeakable moment, and was in fact nothing less than the salvation
of the city. Among all the causes of despair in the Syracusan mind,
there was none more powerful than the circumstance, that they
had not as yet heard of any relief approaching, or of any active
intervention in their favor, from Peloponnesus. Their discouragement
increasing from day to day, and the interchange of propositions
with Nikias becoming more frequent, matters had at last so ripened
that a public assembly was just about to be held to sanction a
definitive capitulation.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391"
class="fnanchor">[391]</a> It was at this critical juncture that
Goggylus arrived, apparently a little before Gylippus reached Himera.
He was the first to announce that both the Corinthian fleet and a
Spartan commander were now actually on their voyage, and might be
expected immediately, intelligence which filled the Syracusans with
enthusiasm and with renewed courage. They instantly threw aside all
idea of capitulation, and resolved to hold out to the last.</p>

<p>It was not long before they received intimation that Gylippus
had reached Himera, which Goggylus at his arrival could not know,
and was raising an army to march across for their relief.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[p. 266]</span> After the interval
necessary for his preparations and for his march, probably not less
than between a fortnight and three weeks, they learned that he was
approaching Syracuse by the way of Euryâlus and Epipolæ. He was
presently seen coming, having ascended Epipolæ by Euryâlus; the same
way by which the Athenians had come from Katana in the spring, when
they commenced the siege. As he descended the slope of Epipolæ, the
whole Syracusan force went out in a body to hail his arrival and
accompany him into the city.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392"
class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>Few incidents throughout the whole siege of Syracuse appear
so unaccountable as the fact, that the proceedings and march of
Gylippus, from his landing at Himera to the moment of his entering
the town, were accomplished without the smallest resistance on
the part of Nikias. After this instant, the besiegers pass from
incontestable superiority in the field, and apparent certainty of
prospective capture of the city, to a state of inferiority, not
only excluding all hope of capture, but even sinking, step by step,
into absolute ruin. Yet Nikias had remained with his eyes shut and
his hands tied, not making the least effort to obstruct so fatal a
consummation. After having despised Gylippus, in his voyage along the
coast of Italy, as a freebooter with four ships, he now despises him
not less at the head of an army marching from Himera. If he was taken
unawares, as he really appears to have been,<a id="FNanchor_393"
href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> the fault was
altogether his own, and the ignorance such as we must almost call
voluntary. For the approach of Gylippus must have been well known
to him beforehand. He must have learned from the four ships which
he sent to Rhegium, that Gylippus had already touched thither in
passing through the strait, on his way to Himera. He must therefore
have been well aware, that the purpose was to attempt the relief of
Syracuse by an army from the interior; and his correspondence among
the Sikel tribes must have placed him in cognizance of the equipment
going on at Himera. Moreover, when we recollect that Gylippus reached
that place without either troops or arms; that he had to obtain
forces not merely from Himera, but also from<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_267">[p. 267]</span> Selinus and Gela, as well as to sound
the Sikel towns, not all of them friendly; lastly, that he had to
march all across the island, partly through hostile territory, it is
impossible to allow less interval than a fortnight or three weeks
between his landing at Himera and his arrival at Epipolæ. Farther,
Nikias must have learned, through his intelligence in the interior of
Syracuse, the important revolution which had taken place in Syracusan
opinion through the arrival of Goggylus, even before the landing of
Gylippus in Sicily was known. He was apprized, from that moment, that
he had to take measures, not only against renewed obstinate hostility
within the town, but against a fresh invading enemy without.
Lastly, that enemy had first to march all across Sicily, during
which march he might have been embarrassed and perhaps defeated,<a
id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> and
could then approach Syracuse only by one road, over the high ground
of Euryâlus in the Athenian rear, through passes few in number, easy
to defend, by which Nikias had himself first approached, and through
which he had only got by a well-laid plan of surprise. Yet Nikias
leaves these passes unoccupied and undefended; he takes not a single
new precaution; the relieving army enters Syracuse as it were over a
broad and free plain.</p>

<p>If we are amazed at the insolent carelessness with which Nikias
disdained the commonest precautions for repelling the foreknown
approach, by sea, of an enemy formidable even single-handed, what are
we to say of that unaccountable blindness which led him to neglect
the same enemy when coming at the head of a relieving army, and to
omit the most obvious means of defence in a crisis upon which his
future fate turned? Homer would have designated such neglect as a
temporary delirium inflicted by the fearful inspiration of Atê: the
historian has no such explanatory name to give, and can only note
it as a sad and suitable prelude to the calamities too nearly at
hand.</p>

<p>At the moment when the fortunate Spartan auxiliary was thus<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[p. 268]</span> allowed to march
quietly into Syracuse, the Athenian double wall of circumvallation,
between the southern cliff of Epipolæ and the Great Harbor, eight
stadia long, was all but completed: a few yards only of the end close
to the harbor were wanting. But Gylippus cared not to interrupt
its completion. He aimed at higher objects, and he knew, what
Nikias, unhappily, never felt and never lived to learn, the immense
advantage of turning to active account that first impression and
full tide of confidence which his arrival had just infused into the
Syracusans. Hardly had he accomplished his junction with them, when
he marshalled the united force in order of battle, and marched up to
the lines of the Athenians. Amazed as they were, and struck dumb by
his unexpected arrival, they too formed in battle order, and awaited
his approach. His first proceeding marked how much the odds of the
game were changed. He sent a herald to tender to them a five days’
armistice, on condition that they should collect their effects and
withdraw from the island. Nikias disdained to return any reply to
this insulting proposal; but his conduct showed how much <i>he</i> felt,
as well as Gylippus, that the tide was now turned. For when the
Spartan commander, perceiving now for the first time the disorderly
trim of his Syracusan hoplites, thought fit to retreat into more open
ground farther removed from the walls, probably in order that he
might have a better field for his cavalry, Nikias declined to follow
him, and remained in position close to his own fortifications.<a
id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
This was tantamount to a confession of inferiority in the field.
It was a virtual abandonment of the capture of Syracuse, a tacit
admission that the Athenians could hope for nothing better in the end
than the humiliating offer which the herald had just made to them.
So it seems to have been felt by both parties; for from this time
forward, the Syracusans become and continue aggressors, the Athenians
remaining always on the defensive, except for one brief instant after
the arrival of Demosthenês.</p>

<p>After drawing off his troops and keeping them encamped for that
night on the Temenite cliff, seemingly within the added fortified
inclosure of Syracuse, Gylippus brought them out again the next
morning, and marshalled them in front of the Athenian<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[p. 269]</span> lines, as if about to
attack. But while the attention of the Athenians was thus engaged,
he sent a detachment to surprise the fort of Labdalum, which was
not within view of their lines. The enterprise was completely
successful. The fort was taken, and the garrison put to the sword;
while the Syracusans gained another unexpected advantage during
the day, by the capture of one of the Athenian triremes which was
watching their harbor. Gylippus pursued his successes actively, by
immediately beginning the construction of a fresh counter-wall, from
the outer city wall in a northwesterly direction aslant up the slope
of Epipolæ; so as to traverse the intended line of the Athenian
circumvallation on the north side of their Circle, and render
blockade impossible. He availed himself, for this purpose, of stones
laid by the Athenians for their own circumvallation, at the same time
alarming them by threatening attack upon their lower wall, between
the southern cliff of Epipolæ and the Great Harbor, which was now
just finished, so as to leave their troops disposable for action on
the higher ground. Against one part of the wall, which seemed weaker
than the rest, he attempted a nocturnal surprise, but finding the
Athenians in vigilant guard without, he was forced to retire. This
part of the wall was now heightened, and the Athenians took charge
of it themselves, distributing their allies along the remainder.<a
id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>These attacks, however, appear to have been chiefly intended
as diversions, in order to hinder the enemy from obstructing the
completion of the counter-wall. Now was the time for Nikias to adopt
vigorous aggressive measures both against this wall and against the
Syracusans in the field, unless he chose to relinquish all hope
of ever being able to beleaguer Syracuse. And, indeed, he seems
actually to have relinquished such hope, even thus early after he had
seemed certain master of the city. For he now undertook a measure
altogether new; highly important in itself, but indicating an altered
scheme of policy. He resolved to fortify Cape Plemmyrium,—the rocky
promontory which forms one extremity of the narrow entrance of the
Great Harbor, immediately south of the point of Ortygia,—and to make
it a secure main station for the fleet and stores. The fleet had
been hitherto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[p. 270]</span>
stationed in close neighborhood of the land-force, in a fortified
position at the extremity of the double blockading wall between the
southern cliff of Epipolæ and the Great Harbor. From such a station
in the interior of the harbor, it was difficult for the Athenian
triremes to perform the duties incumbent on them, of watching the two
ports of Syracuse—one on each side of the isthmus which joins Ortygia
to the mainland—so as to prevent any exit of ships from within, or
ingress of ships from without, and of insuring the unobstructed
admission by sea of supplies for their own army. For both these
purposes, the station of Plemmyrium was far more convenient; and
Nikias now saw that henceforward his operations would be for the most
part maritime. Without confessing it openly, he thus practically
acknowledged that the superiority of land-force had passed to
the side of his opponents, and that a successful prosecution
of the blockade had become impossible.<a id="FNanchor_397"

<p>Three forts, one of considerable size and two subsidiary, were
erected on the seaboard of Cape Plemmyrium, which became the station
for triremes as well as for ships of burden. Though the situation
was found convenient for all naval operations, it entailed also
serious disadvantages; being destitute of any spring of water,
such as the memorable fountain of Arethusa on the opposite island
of Ortygia. So that for supplies of water, and of wood also, the
crews of the ships had to range a considerable distance, exposed to
surprise from the numerous Syracusan cavalry placed in garrison at
the temple of Zeus Olympius. Day after day, losses were sustained in
this manner, besides the increased facilities given for desertion,
which soon fatally diminished the efficiency of each ship’s crew.
As the Athenian hopes of success now declined, both the slaves and
the numerous foreigners who served in their navy became disposed to
steal away. And though the ships of war, down to this time, had been
scarcely at all engaged in actual warfare, yet they had been for many
months continually at sea and on the watch, without any opportunity
of hauling ashore to refit. Hence the naval force, now about to be
called into action as the chief hope of the Athenians, was found
lamentably degenerated from that ostentatious perfection<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[p. 271]</span> in which it had set
sail fifteen months before, from the harbor of Peiræus.</p>

<p>The erection of the new forts at Plemmyrium, while by withdrawing
the Athenian forces it left Gylippus unopposed in the prosecution of
his counter-wall, at the same time emboldened him by the manifest
decline of hope which it implied. Day after day he brought out his
Syracusans in battle-array, planting them near the Athenian lines;
but the Athenians showed no disposition to attack. At length he
took advantage of what he thought a favorable opportunity to make
the attack himself; but the ground was so hemmed in by various
walls—the Athenian fortified lines on one side, the Syracusan front
or Temenitic fortification on another, and the counter-wall now in
course of construction on a third—that his cavalry and darters had no
space to act. Accordingly, the Syracusan hoplites, having to fight
without these auxiliaries, were beaten and driven back with loss,
the Corinthian Goggylus being among the slain.<a id="FNanchor_398"
href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> On the next day,
Gylippus had the prudence to take the blame of this defeat upon
himself. It was all owing to his mistake, he publicly confessed,
in having made choice of a confined space wherein neither cavalry
nor darters could avail. He would presently give them another
opportunity, in a fairer field, and he exhorted them to show their
inbred superiority, as Dorians and Peloponnesians, by chasing these
Ionians with their rabble of islanders out of Sicily. Accordingly,
after no long time, he again brought them up in order of battle;
taking care, however, to keep in the open space, beyond the extremity
of the walls and fortifications.</p>

<p>On this occasion, Nikias did not decline the combat, but marched
out into the open space to meet him. He probably felt encouraged
by the result of the recent action; but there was a farther and
more pressing motive. The counter-wall of intersection, which the
Syracusans were constructing, was on the point of cutting the
Athenian line of circumvallation, so that it was essential for Nikias
to attack without delay, unless he formally abnegated all farther
hope of successful siege. Nor could the army endure, in spite of
altered fortune, irrevocably to shut themselves out from such hope,
without one struggle more. Both armies were<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_272">[p. 272]</span> therefore ranged in battle order on
the open space beyond the walls, higher up the slope of Epipolæ;
Gylippus placing his cavalry and darters to the right of his line, on
the highest and most open ground. In the midst of the action between
the hoplites on both sides, these troops on the right charged the
left flank of the Athenians with such vigor, that they completely
broke it. The whole Athenian army underwent a thorough defeat, and
only found shelter within its fortified lines. And in the course of
the very next night, the Syracusan counter-wall was pushed so far as
to traverse and get beyond the projected line of Athenian blockade,
reaching presently as far as the edge of the northern cliff: so that
Syracuse was now safe, unless the enemy should not only recover their
superiority in the field, but also become strong enough to storm and
carry the new-built wall.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399"
class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>Farther defence was also obtained by the safe arrival of the
Corinthian, Ambrakiotic, and Leukadian fleet of twelve triremes,
under Erasinidês, which Nikias had vainly endeavored to intercept.
He had sent twenty sail to the southern coast of Italy; but the
new-comers had had the good luck to avoid them.</p>

<p>Erasinidês and his division lent their hands to the execution of
a work which completed the scheme of defence for the city. Gylippus
took the precaution of constructing a fort or redoubt on the high
ground of Epipolæ, so as to command the approach to Syracuse from
the high ground of Euryalus; a step which Hermokratês had not
thought of until too late, and which Nikias had never thought of
at all, during his period of triumph and mastery. He erected a
new fort on a suitable point of the high ground, backed by three
fortified positions or encampments at proper distances in the rear
of it, intended for bodies of troops to support the advanced post in
case it was attacked. A continuous wall was then carried from this
advanced post down the slope of Epipolæ, so as to reach and join
the counter-wall recently constructed; whereby this counter-wall,
already traversing and cutting the Athenian line of circumvallation,
became in fact prolonged up the whole slope of Epipolæ, and barred
all direct access from the Athenians in their existing lines up to
the summit of that eminence, as well as up to the northern cliff. The
Syracusans had now one continuous and uninterrupted line of defence;
a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[p. 273]</span> single
wall, resting at one extremity on the new-built fort upon the high
ground of Epipolæ, at the other extremity, upon the city wall. This
wall was only single; but it was defended, along its whole length,
by the permanent detachments occupying the three several fortified
positions or encampments just mentioned. One of these positions
was occupied by native Syracusans; a second, by Sicilian Greeks; a
third, by other allies. Such was the improved and systematic scheme
of defence which the genius of Gylippus first projected, and which
he brought to execution at the present moment:<a id="FNanchor_400"
href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> a scheme, the full
value of which will be appreciated when we come to describe the
proceedings of the second Athenian armament under Demosthenês.</p>

<p>Not content with having placed the Syracusans out of the reach
of danger, Gylippus took advantage of their renewed confidence to
infuse into them projects of retaliation against the enemy who had
brought them so near to ruin. They began to equip their ships in
the harbor, and to put their seamen under training, in hopes of
qualifying themselves to contend with the Athenians even on their own
element; while Gylippus himself quitted the city to visit the various
cities of the island, and to get together farther reinforcements,
naval as well as military. And as it was foreseen that Nikias on
his part would probably demand aid from Athens, envoys, Syracusan
as well as Corinthian, were despatched to Peloponnesus, to urge
the necessity of forwarding additional troops, even in merchant
vessels, if no triremes could be spared to convey them.<a
id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>
Should no reinforcements reach the Athenian<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_274">[p. 274]</span> camp, the Syracusans well knew that
its efficiency must diminish by every month’s delay, while their own
strength, in spite of heavy cost and effort, was growing with their
increased prospects of success.</p>

<p>If this double conviction was present to sustain, the ardor of the
Syracusans, it was not less painfully felt amidst the Athenian camp,
now blocked up like a besieged city, and enjoying no free movement
except through their ships and their command of the sea. Nikias saw
that if Gylippus should return with any considerable additional
force, even the attack upon him by land would become too powerful
to resist, besides the increasing disorganization of his fleet. He
became fully convinced that to remain as they were was absolute ruin.
As all possibility of prosecuting the siege of Syracuse successfully
was now at an end, a sound judgment would have dictated that his
position in the harbor had become useless as well as dangerous, and
that the sooner it was evacuated the better. Probably Demosthenês
would have acted thus, under similar circumstances; but such
foresight and resolution were not in the character of Nikias, who was
afraid, moreover, of the blame which it would bring down upon him at
home, if not from his own army. Not venturing to quit his position
without orders from Athens, he determined to send home thither an
undisguised account of his critical position, and to solicit either
reinforcements or instructions to return.</p>

<p>It was now, indeed, the end of September (<small>B.C.</small>
414), so that he could not even hope for an answer before midwinter,
nor for reinforcements, if such were to be sent, until the ensuing
spring was far advanced. Nevertheless, he determined to encounter
this risk, and to trust to vigilant precautions for safety during
the interval, precautions which, as the result will show, were
within a hair’s breadth of proving insufficient. But as it was of
the last importance to him to make his countrymen at home fully
sensible of the grave danger of his position, he resolved to
transmit a written despatch; not trusting to the oral statement of
a messenger, who might be wanting either in courage, in presence of
mind, or in competent expression, to impress the full and sad truth
upon a reluctant audience.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402"
class="fnanchor">[402]</a> Accordingly he sent home a despatch,
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[p. 275]</span> seems to
have reached Athens about the end of November, and was read formally
in the public assembly by the secretary of the city. Preserved
by Thucydidês verbatim, it stands as one of the most interesting
remnants of antiquity, and well deserves a literal translation.</p>

<p>“Our previous proceedings have been already made known to
you, Athenians, in many other despatches;<a id="FNanchor_403"
href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> but the present
crisis is such as to require your deliberation more than ever, when
you shall have heard the situation in which we stand. After we
had overcome in many engagements the Syracusans, against whom we
were sent, and had built the fortified lines which we now occupy,
there came upon us the Lacedæmonian Gylippus, with an army partly
Peloponnesian, partly Sicilian. Him too we defeated, in the first
action; but in a second, we were overwhelmed by a crowd of cavalry
and darters, and forced to retire within our lines. And thus the
superior number of our enemies has compelled us to suspend our
circumvallation, and remain inactive; indeed, we cannot employ in
the field even the full force which we possess, since a portion of
our hoplites are necessarily required for the protection of our
walls. Meanwhile the enemy have carried out a single intersecting
counter-wall beyond our line of circumvallation, so that we can
no longer continue the latter to completion, unless we have force
enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[p. 276]</span> attack
and storm their counter-wall. And things have come to such a pass,
that we, who profess to besiege others, are ourselves rather the
party besieged, by land at least, since the cavalry leave us scarce
any liberty of motion. Farther, the enemy have sent envoys to
Peloponnesus to obtain reinforcements, while Gylippus in person is
going round the Sicilian cities, trying to stir up to action such
of them as are now neutral, and to get, from the rest, additional
naval and military supplies. For it is their determination, as I
understand, not merely to assail our lines on shore with their
land-force, but also to attack us by sea with their ships.</p>

<p>“Be not shocked when I tell you, that they intend to become
aggressors even at sea. They know well, that our fleet was at
first in high condition, with dry ships<a id="FNanchor_404"
href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> and excellent crews;
but now the ships have rotted, from remaining too long at sea, and
the crews are ruined. Nor have we the means of hauling our ships
ashore to refit, since the enemy’s fleet, equal or superior in
numbers, always appears on the point of attacking us. We see them in
constant practice, and they can choose their own moment for attack.
Moreover, they can keep their ships high and dry more than we can;
for they are not engaged in maintaining watch upon others; while to
us, who are obliged to retain all our fleet on guard, nothing less
than prodigious superiority of number could insure the like facility.
And were we to relax ever so little in our vigilance, we should no
longer be sure of our supplies, which we bring in even now with
difficulty close under their walls.</p>

<p>“Our crews, too, have been and are still wasting away from various
causes. Among the seamen who are our own citizens, many, in going
to a distance for wood, for water, or for pillage, are cut off by
the Syracusan cavalry. Such of them as are slaves, desert, now that
our superiority is gone, and that we have come to equal chances with
our enemy; while the foreigners whom we pressed into our service,
make off straight to some of the neighboring cities; and those
who came, tempted by high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[p.
277]</span> pay, under the idea of enriching themselves by traffic
rather than of fighting, now that they find the enemy in full
competence to cope with us by sea as well as by land, either go
over to him as professed deserters, or get away as they can amidst
the wide area of Sicily.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405"
class="fnanchor">[405]</a> Nay, there are even some, who, while
trafficking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[p. 278]</span>
here on their own account, bribe the trierarchs to accept Hykkarian
slaves as substitutes, and thus destroy the strict discipline of our
marine. And you know as well as I, that no crew ever continues long
in perfect condition, and that the first class of seamen, who set the
ship in motion, and maintain the uniformity of the oar-stroke, is but
a small fraction of the whole number.</p>

<p>“Among all these embarrassments, the worst of all is, that I as
general can neither prevent the mischief, from the difficulty of
your tempers to govern, nor can I provide supplementary recruits
elsewhere, as the enemy can easily do from many places open to him.
We have nothing but the original stock which we brought out with
us, both to make good losses and to do present duty; for Naxus and
Katana, our only present allies, are of insignificant strength. And
if our enemy gain but one farther point,—if the Italian cities,
from whence we now draw our supplies, should turn against us, under
the impression of our present bad condition, with no reinforcement
arriving from you,—we shall be starved out, and he will bring the war
to triumphant close, even without a battle.</p>

<p>“Pleasanter news than these I could easily have found to send
you; but assuredly nothing so useful, seeing that the full knowledge
of the state of affairs here is essential to your deliberations.
Moreover, I thought it even the safer policy to tell you the truth
without disguise, understanding as I do your real dispositions, that
you never listen willingly to any but the most favorable assurances,
yet are angry in the end if they turn to unfavorable results. Be
thoroughly satisfied, that in regard to the force against which you
originally sent us, both your generals and your soldiers have done
themselves no discredit. But now that all Sicily is united against
us, and that farther reinforcements are expected from Peloponnesus,
you must take your resolution with full knowledge that we here have
not even strength to contend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[p.
279]</span> against our present difficulties. You must either send
for us home, or you must send us a second army, land-force as well
as naval, not inferior to that which is now here, together with a
considerable supply of money. You must farther send a successor
to supersede me, as I am incapable of work from a disease in the
kidneys. I think myself entitled to ask this indulgence at your
hands, for while my health lasted I did you much good service in
various military commands. But whatever you intend, do it at the
first opening of spring, without any delay: for the new succors
which the enemy is getting together in Sicily, will soon be here,
and those which are to come from Peloponnesus, though they will be
longer in arriving, yet, if you do not keep watch, will either elude
or forestall you as they have already once done.”<a id="FNanchor_406"
href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>Such was the memorable despatch of Nikias, which was read to the
public assembly of Athens about the end of November, or beginning of
December, 414 <small>B.C.</small>, brought by officers
who strengthened its effect by their own oral communications, and
answered all such inquiries as were put to them.<a id="FNanchor_407"
href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> We have much reason
to regret that Thucydidês does not give us any idea of the debate
which so gloomy a revelation called forth. He tells us merely the
result: the Athenians resolved to comply with the second portion of
the alternative put by Nikias; not to send for the present armament
home, but to reinforce it by a second powerful armament, both of
land and naval force, in prosecution of the same objects. But they
declined his other personal request, and insisted on continuing him
in command; passing a vote, however, to name Menander and Euthydemus,
officers already in the army before Syracuse, joint commanders along
with him, in order to assist him in his laborious duties. They sent
Eurymedon speedily, about the winter solstice, in command of ten
triremes to Syracuse, carrying one hundred and twenty talents of
silver, together with assurances of coming aid to the suffering
army. And they resolved to equip a new and formidable force, under
Demosthenês and Eurymedon, to go thither as reinforcement in the
earliest months of the spring. Demosthenês<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_280">[p. 280]</span> was directed to employ himself
actively in getting this larger force ready.<a id="FNanchor_408"
href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>This letter of Nikias—so authentic, so full of matter, and so
characteristic of the manners of the time—suggests several serious
reflections, in reference both to himself and to the Athenian people.
As to himself, there is nothing so remarkable as the sentence of
condemnation which it pronounces on his own past proceedings in
Sicily. When we find him lamenting the wear and tear of the armament,
and treating the fact as notorious that even the best naval force
could only maintain itself in good condition for a short time,
what graver condemnation could be passed upon those eight months
which he wasted in trifling measures, after his arrival in Sicily,
before commencing the siege of Syracuse? When he announces that the
arrival of Gylippus with his auxiliary force before Syracuse, made
the difference to the Athenian army between triumph and something
bordering on ruin, the inquiry naturally suggests itself, whether he
had done his best to anticipate, and what precautions he had himself
taken to prevent, the coming of the Spartan general. To which the
answer must be, that, so far from anticipating the arrival of new
enemies as a possible danger, he had almost invited them from abroad
by his delay, and that he had taken no precautions at all against
them, though forewarned and having sufficient means at his disposal.
The desertion and demoralization of his naval force, doubtless but
too real, was, as he himself points out, mainly the consequence
of this turn of fortune, and was also the first commencement
of that unmanageable temper of the Athenian soldiery, numbered
among his difficulties. For it would be in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_281">[p. 281]</span>justice to this unfortunate army not
to recognize that they first acquiesced patiently in prolonged
inaction, because their general directed it, and next did their duty
most gallantly in the operations of the siege, down to the death of
Lamachus.</p>

<p>If even with our imperfect knowledge of the case, the ruin
complained of by Nikias be distinctly traceable to his own
remissness and oversight, much more must this conviction have been
felt by intelligent Athenians, both in the camp and in the city,
as we shall see by the conduct of Demosthenês<a id="FNanchor_409"
href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> hereafter to be
related. Let us conceive the series of despatches, to which Nikias
himself alludes, as having been transmitted home, from their
commencement. We must recollect that the expedition was originally
sent from Athens with hopes of the most glowing character, and
with a consciousness of extraordinary efforts about to be rewarded
with commensurate triumphs. For some months, the despatches of the
general disclose nothing but movements either abortive or inglorious;
adorned, indeed, by one barren victory, but accompanied by an
intimation that he must wait till the spring, and that reinforcements
must be sent to him, before he can undertake the really serious
enterprise. Though the disappointment occasioned by this news at
Athens must have been mortifying, nevertheless his requisition was
complied with; and the despatches of Nikias, during the spring and
summer of 414 <small>B.C.</small>, become cheering. The
siege of Syracuse is described as proceeding successfully, and at
length, about July or August, as being on the point of coming to a
triumphant close, in spite of a Spartan adventurer, named Gylippus,
making his way across the Ionian sea with a force too contemptible
to be noticed. Suddenly, without any intermediate step to smooth the
transition, comes a despatch announcing that this adventurer has
marched into Syracuse at the head of a powerful army, and that the
Athenians are thrown upon the defensive, without power of proceeding
with the siege. This is followed, after a short time, by the gloomy
and almost desperate communication above translated.</p>

<p>When we thus look at the despatch, not merely as it stands singly,
but as falling in series with its antecedents, the natural<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[p. 282]</span> effect which we should
suppose it likely to produce upon the Athenians, would be a vehement
burst of wrath and displeasure against Nikias. Upon the most candid
and impartial scrutiny, he deserved nothing less. And when we
consider, farther, the character generally ascribed by historians of
Greece to the Athenian people, that they are represented as fickle,
ungrateful, and irritable, by standing habit; as abandoning upon the
most trifling grounds those whom they had once esteemed, forgetting
all prior services, visiting upon innocent generals the unavoidable
misfortunes of war, and impelled by nothing better than demagogic
excitements, we naturally expect that the blame really deserved by
Nikias would be exaggerated beyond all due measure, and break forth
in a storm of violence and fury. Yet what is the actual resolution
taken in consequence of his despatch, after the full and free debate
of the Athenian assembly? Not a word of blame or displeasure is
proclaimed. Doubtless there must have been individual speakers who
criticized him as he deserved. To suppose the contrary, would be to
think meanly indeed of the Athenian assembly. But the general vote
was one not simply imputing no blame, but even pronouncing continued
and unabated confidence. The people positively refuse to relieve him
from the command, though he himself solicits it in a manner sincere
and even touching. So great is the value which they set upon his
services, and the esteem which they entertain for his character,
that they will not avail themselves of the easy opportunity which he
himself provides to get rid of him.</p>

<p>It is not by way of compliment to the Athenians that I make
these remarks on their present proceeding. Quite the contrary. The
misplaced confidence of the Athenians in Nikias, on more than one
previous occasion, but especially on this, betrays an incapacity of
appreciating facts immediately before their eyes, and a blindness to
decisive and multiplied evidences of incompetency, which is one of
the least creditable manifestations of their political history. But
we do learn from it a clear lesson, that the habitual defects of the
Athenian character were very different from what historians commonly
impute to them. Instead of being fickle, we find them tenacious in
the extreme of confidence once bestowed, and of schemes once embarked
upon: instead of ingratitude for services actually rendered, we
find credit given for ser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[p.
283]</span>vices which an officer ought to have rendered, but has
not: instead of angry captiousness, we discover an indulgence not
merely generous, but even culpable, in the midst of disappointment
and humiliation: instead of a public assembly, wherein, as it is
commonly depicted, the criminative orators were omnipotent, and could
bring to condemnation any unsuccessful general, however meritorious;
we see that even grave and well-founded accusations make no
impression upon the people in opposition to preëstablished personal
esteem; and personal esteem for a man who not only was no demagogue,
but in every respect the opposite of a demagogue: an oligarch by
taste, sentiment, and position; who yielded to the democracy nothing
more than sincere obedience, coupled with gentleness and munificence
in his private bearing. If Kleon had committed but a small part
of those capital blunders which discredit the military career of
Nikias, he would have been irretrievably ruined. So much weaker was
<i>his</i> hold upon his countrymen, by means of demagogic excellences,
as compared with those causes which attracted confidence to Nikias;
his great family and position, his wealth dexterously expended, his
known incorruptibility against bribes, and even comparative absence
of personal ambition, his personal courage combined with reputation
for caution, his decorous private life and ultra-religious habits.
All this assemblage of negative merits, and decencies of daily life,
in a citizen whose station might have enabled him to act with the
insolence of Alkibiadês, placed Nikias on a far firmer basis of
public esteem than the mere power of accusatory speech in the public
assembly or the dikastery could have done. It entitled him to have
the most indulgent construction put upon all his shortcomings, and
spread a fatal varnish over his glaring incompetence for all grave
and responsible command.</p>

<p>The incident now before us is one of the most instructive in all
history, as an illustration of the usual sentiment, and strongest
causes of error, prevalent among the Athenian democracy, and as a
refutation of that exaggerated mischief which it is common to impute
to the person called a demagogue. Happy would it have been for Athens
had she now had Kleon present, or any other demagogue of equal
power, at that public assembly which took the melancholy resolution
of sending fresh forces to Sicily and continuing Nikias in the
command! The case was one in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[p.
284]</span> which the accusatory eloquence of the demagogue was
especially called for, to expose the real past mismanagement of
Nikias, to break down that undeserved confidence in his ability
and caution which had grown into a sentiment of faith or routine,
to prove how much mischief he had already done, and how much more
he would do if continued.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410"
class="fnanchor">[410]</a> Unluckily for Athens, she had now no
demagogue who could convince the assembly beforehand of this truth,
and prevent them from taking the most unwise and destructive
resolution ever passed in the Pnyx.</p>

<p>What makes the resolution so peculiarly discreditable, is,
that it was adopted in defiance of clear and present evidence. To
persist in the siege of Syracuse, under present circumstances, was
sad misjudgment; to persist in it with Nikias as commander, was
hardly less than insanity. The first expedition, though even <i>that</i>
was rash and ill-conceived, nevertheless presented tempting hopes
which explain, if they do not excuse, the too light estimate of
impossibility of lasting possession. Moreover, there was at that
time a confusion,—between the narrow objects connected with Leontini
and Egesta, and the larger acquisitions to be realized through the
siege of Syracuse,—which prevented any clear and unanimous estimate
of the undertaking in the Athenian mind. But now, the circumstances
of Sicily were fully known: the mendacious promises of Egesta had
been exposed; the hopes of allies for Athens in the island were
seen to be futile; while Syracuse, armed with a Spartan general and
Peloponnesian aid, had not only become inexpugnable, but had assumed
the aggressive: lastly, the chance of a renewal of Peloponnesian
hostility against Attica had been now raised into certainty. While
perseverance in the siege of Syracuse, therefore, under circumstances
so unpromising and under such necessity for increased exertions
at home, was a melancholy imprudence in itself, perseverance in
employing Nikias converted that imprudence into ruin, which even
the addition of an energetic colleague in the person of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[p. 285]</span> Demosthenês was not
sufficient to avert. Those who study the conduct of the Athenian
people on this occasion, will not be disposed to repeat against them
the charge of fickleness which forms one of the standing reproaches
against democracy. Their mistake here arose from the very opposite
quality; from what may be called obtuseness, or inability to get
clear of two sentiments which had become deeply engraven on their
minds; ideas of Sicilian conquest, and confidence in Nikias.</p>

<p>A little more of this alleged fickleness—or easy escape from past
associations and impressibility to actual circumstances—would have
been at the present juncture a tutelary quality to Athens. She would
then have appreciated more justly the increased hazards thickening
around her both in Sicily and at home. War with Sparta, though
not yet actually proclaimed, had become impending and inevitable.
Even in the preceding winter, the Lacedæmonians had listened
favorably to the recommendation of Alkibiadês<a id="FNanchor_411"
href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> that they should
establish a fortified post at Dekeleia in Attica. They had not yet
indeed brought themselves to execution of this resolve; for the peace
between them and Athens, though indirectly broken in many ways,
still subsisted in name, and they hesitated to break it openly,
partly because they knew that the breach of peace had been on their
side at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war; attributing to this
fault their capital misfortune at Sphakteria.<a id="FNanchor_412"
href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> Athens on her side
had also scrupulously avoided direct violation of the Lacedæmonian
territory, in spite of much solicitation from her allies at Argos.
But her reserve on this point gave way during the present summer,
probably at the time when her prospect of taking Syracuse appeared
certain. The Lacedæmonians having invaded and plundered the Argeian
territory, thirty Athenian triremes were sent to aid in its defence,
under Pythodôrus with two colleagues. This armament disembarked on
the eastern coast of Laconia near Prasiæ and committed devastations:
which direct act of hostility—coming in addition to the marauding
excursions of the garrison of Pylos, and to the refusal of pacific
redress at Athens—satisfied the Lacedæmonians that the peace
had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[p. 286]</span> been now
first and undeniably broken by their enemy, so that they might
with a safe conscience recommence the war.<a id="FNanchor_413"
href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p>Such was the state of feeling between the two great powers of
Central Greece in November 414 <small>B.C.</small>,
when the envoys arrived from Syracuse; envoys from Nikias on the
one part, from Gylippus and the Syracusans on the other; each
urgently calling for farther support. The Corinthians and Syracusans
vehemently pressed their claims at Sparta; nor was Alkibiadês again
wanting, to renew his instances for the occupation of Dekeleia. It
was in the face of this impending liability to renewed Peloponnesian
invasion that the Athenians took their resolution, above commented
on, to send a second army to Syracuse and prosecute the siege with
vigor. If there were any hesitation yet remaining on the part of the
Lacedæmonians, it disappeared so soon as they were made aware of the
imprudent resolution of Athens; which not only created an imperative
necessity for sustaining Syracuse, but also rendered Athens so much
more vulnerable at home, by removing the better part of her force.
Accordingly, very soon after the vote passed at Athens, an equally
decisive resolution for direct hostilities was adopted at Sparta.
It was determined that a Peloponnesian allied force should be
immediately prepared, to be sent at the first opening of spring to
Syracuse, and that at the same time Attica should be invaded, and the
post of Dekeleia fortified. Orders to this effect were immediately
transmitted to the whole body of Peloponnesian allies; especially
requisitions for implements, materials, and workmen, towards the
construction of the projected fort at Dekeleia.<a id="FNanchor_414"

  FROM THE RESUMPTION OF DIRECT HOSTILITIES BETWEEN ATHENS AND SPARTA,
  DOWN TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ATHENIAN ARMAMENT IN SICILY.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Syracusan war now
no longer stands apart, as an event by itself, but becomes absorbed
in the general war rekindling throughout Greece. Never was any winter
so actively and extensively employed in military preparations, as
the winter of 414-413 <small>B.C.</small>, the months immediately
preceding that which Thucydidês terms the nineteenth spring of the
Peloponnesian war, but which other historians call the beginning
of the Dekeleian war.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415"
class="fnanchor">[415]</a> While Eurymedon went with his ten triremes
to Syracuse, even in midwinter, Demosthenês exerted himself all the
winter to get together the second armament for early spring. Twenty
other Athenian triremes were farther sent round Peloponnesus to
the station of Naupaktus, to prevent any Corinthian reinforcements
from sailing out of the Corinthian gulf. Against these latter, the
Corinthians on their side prepared twenty-five fresh triremes, to
serve as a convoy to the transports carrying their hoplites.<a
id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>
In Corinth, Sikyôn, and Bœotia, as well as at Lacedæmon, levies of
hoplites were going on for the armament to Syracuse, at the same time
that everything was getting ready for the occupation of Dekeleia.
Lastly, Gylippus was engaged with not less activity in stirring
up all Sicily to take a more decisive part in the coming year’s
struggle.</p>

<p>From Cape Tænarus in Laconia, at the earliest moment of spring,
embarked a force of six hundred Lacedæmonian hoplites—Helots and
Neodamodes—under the Spartan Ekkritus, and three hundred Bœotian
hoplites under the Thebans Xenon and Nikon, with the Thespian
Hegesandrus. They were directed to cross the sea southward to Kyrênê
in Libya, and from thence to make their way along the African
coast to Sicily. At the same time a body of seven hundred hoplites
under Alexarchus, partly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[p.
288]</span> Corinthians, partly hired Arcadians, partly Sikyonians,
under constraint from their powerful neighbors,<a id="FNanchor_417"
href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> departed from the
northwest of Peloponnesus and the mouth of the Corinthian gulf for
Sicily, the Corinthian triremes watching them until they were past
the Athenian squadron at Naupaktus.</p>

<p>These were proceedings of importance: but the most important of
all was the reinvasion of Attica at the same time by the great force
of the Peloponnesian alliance, under the Spartan king Agis son of
Archidamus. Twelve years had elapsed since Attica last felt the
hand of the destroyer, a little before the siege of Sphakteria. The
plain in the neighborhood of Athens was now first laid waste, after
which the invaders proceeded to their special purpose of erecting
a fortified post for occupation at Dekeleia. The work, apportioned
among the allies present, who had come prepared with the means
of executing it, was completed during the present summer, and a
garrison was established there composed of contingents relieving
each other at intervals, under the command of king Agis himself.
Dekeleia was situated on an outlying eminence belonging to the range
called Parnês, about fourteen miles to the north of Athens, near
the termination of the plain of Athens, and commanding an extensive
view of that plain as well as of the plain of Eleusis. The hill on
which it stood, if not the fort itself, was visible even from the
walls of Athens. It was admirably situated both as a central point
for excursions over Attica, and for communication with Bœotia; while
the road from Athens to Orôpus, the main communication with Eubœa,
passed through the gorge immediately under it.<a id="FNanchor_418"
href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>We read with amazement, and the contemporary world saw with yet
greater amazement, that while this important work was actually going
on, and while the whole Peloponnesian confederacy was renewing its
pressure with redoubled force upon Athens, at that very moment,<a
id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>
the Athenians sent out, not only a fleet of thirty triremes
under Chariklês to annoy the coasts of Peloponnesus, but also
the great armament which they had resolved<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_289">[p. 289]</span> upon under Demosthenês, to push
offensive operations against Syracuse. The force under the latter
general consisted of sixty Athenian and five Chian triremes; of
twelve hundred Athenian hoplites of the best class, chosen from the
citizen muster-roll; with a considerable number of hoplites besides,
from the subject-allies and elsewhere. There had been also engaged
on hire fifteen hundred peltasts from Thrace, of the tribe called
Dii; but these men did not arrive in time, so that Demosthenês
set sail without them.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420"
class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Chariklês having gone forward to take
aboard a body of allies from Argos, the two fleets joined at Ægina,
inflicted some devastations on the coasts of Laconia, and established
a strong post on the island of Kythêra to encourage desertion among
the Helots. From hence Chariklês returned with the Argeians, while
Demosthenês conducted his armament round Peloponnesus to Korkyra.<a
id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
On the Eleian coast, he destroyed a transport carrying hoplites to
Syracuse, though the men escaped ashore: from thence he proceeded to
Zakynthus and Kephallenia, from whence he engaged some additional
hoplites, and to Anaktorium, in order to procure darters and slingers
from Akarnania. It was here that he was met by Eurymedon with his
ten triremes, who had gone forward to Syracuse in the winter with
the pecuniary remittance urgently required, and was now returning to
act as colleague of Demosthenês in the command.<a id="FNanchor_422"
href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> The news<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[p. 290]</span> brought by Eurymedon
from Sicily was in every way discouraging. Yet the two admirals
were under the necessity of sparing ten triremes from their fleet
to reinforce Konon at Naupaktus, who was not strong enough alone
to contend against the Corinthian fleet which watched him from the
opposite coast. To make good this diminution, Eurymedon went forward
to Korkyra, with the view of obtaining from the Korkyræans fifteen
fresh triremes and a contingent of hoplites, while Demosthenês
was getting together the Akarnanian darters and slingers.<a
id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>Eurymedon not only brought back word of the distressed condition
of the Athenians in the harbor of Syracuse, but had also learned,
during his way back, their heavy additional loss by the capture of
the fort at Plemmyrium. Gylippus returned to Syracuse early in the
spring, nearly about the time when Agis invaded Attica and when
Demosthenês quitted Peiræus. He returned with fresh reinforcements
from the interior, and with redoubled ardor for decisive operations
against Nikias before aid could arrive from Athens. It was his first
care, in conjunction with Hermokratês, to inspire the Syracusans
with courage for fighting the Athenians on shipboard. Such was the
acknowledged superiority of the latter at sea, that this was a task
of some difficulty, calling for all the eloquence and ascendency of
the two leaders: “The Athenians (said Hermokratês to his countrymen)
have not been always eminent at sea as they now are: they were
once landsmen like you, and more than you, they were only forced
on shipboard by the Persian invasion. The only way to deal with
bold men like them, is to show a front bolder still. <i>They</i> have
often by their audacity daunted enemies of greater real force than
themselves, and they must now be taught that others can play the same
game with them. Go right at them before they expect it; and you will
gain more by thus surprising and intimidating them, than you will
suffer by their superior science.” Such lessons, addressed to men
already in the tide of success, were presently efficacious, and a
naval attack was resolved.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424"
class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_291">[p. 291]</span></p> <p>The town of Syracuse had two
ports, one on each side of the island of Ortygia. The lesser port—as
it was called afterwards, the Portus Lakkius—lay northward of
Ortygia, between that island and the low ground or Nekropolis near
the outer city: the other lay on the opposite side of the isthmus
of Ortygia within the Great Harbor. Both of them, it appears, were
protected against attack from without, by piles and stakes planted in
the bottom in front of them. But the lesser port was the more secure
of the two, and the principal docks of the Syracusans were situated
within it; the Syracusan fleet, eighty triremes strong, being
distributed between them. The entire Athenian fleet was stationed
under the fort of Plemmyrium, immediately opposite to the southern
point of Ortygia.</p>

<p>Gylippus laid his plan with great ability, so as to take the
Athenians completely by surprise. Having trained and prepared the
naval force as thoroughly as he could, he marched out his land-force
secretly by night, over Epipolæ and round by the right bank of the
Anapus, to the neighborhood of the fort of Plemmyrium. With the first
dawn of morning, the Syracusan fleet sailed out, at one and the same
signal, from both the ports; forty-five triremes out of the lesser
port, thirty-five out of the other. Both squadrons tried to round the
southern point of Ortygia, so as to unite and to attack the enemy at
Plemmyrium in concert. The Athenians, though unprepared and confused,
hastened to man sixty ships; with twenty-five of which, they met the
thirty-five Syracusans sailing forth from the Great Harbor, while
with the other thirty-five they encountered the forty-five from the
lesser port, immediately outside of the mouth of the Great Harbor. In
the former of these two actions the Syracusans were at first victors;
in the second also, the Syracusans from the outside forced their
way into the mouth of the Great Harbor, and joined their comrades.
But being little accustomed to naval warfare, they presently fell
into complete confusion, partly in consequence of their unexpected
success: so that the Athenians, recovering from the first shock,
attacked them anew and completely defeated them; sinking or
disabling eleven ships, of three of which the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_292">[p. 292]</span> crews were made prisoners, the rest
being mostly slain.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425"
class="fnanchor">[425]</a> Three Athenian triremes were destroyed
also.</p>

<p>But this victory, itself not easily won, was more than
counterbalanced by the irreparable loss of Plemmyrium. During the
first excitement at the Athenian naval station, when the ships were
in course of being manned to meet the unexpected onset from both
ports at once, the garrison of Plemmyrium went to the water’s edge to
watch and encourage their countrymen, leaving their own walls thinly
guarded, and little suspecting the presence of their enemy on the
land side. This was just what Gylippus had anticipated. He attacked
the forts at daybreak, taking the garrison completely by surprise,
and captured them after a feeble resistance; first the greatest
and most important fort, next the two smaller. The garrison sought
safety as they could, on board the transports and vessels of burden
at the station, and rowed across the Great Harbor to the land-camp
of Nikias on the other side. Those who fled from the greater fort,
which was the first taken, ran some risk from the Syracusan triremes,
which were at that moment victorious at sea. But by the time that
the two lesser forts were taken, the Athenian fleet had regained its
superiority, so that there was no danger of similar pursuit in the
crossing of the Great Harbor.</p>

<p>This well-concerted surprise was no less productive to the captors
than fatal as a blow to the Athenians. Not only were many men slain,
and many made prisoners, in the assault, but there were vast stores
of every kind, and even a large stock of money found within the
fort; partly belonging to the military chest, partly the property
of the trierarchs and of private merchants, who had deposited it
there as in the place of greatest security. The sails of not less
than forty triremes were also found there, and three triremes
which had been dragged up ashore. Gylippus caused one of the three
forts to be pulled down, and carefully garrisoned the other two.<a
id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>Great as the positive loss was here to the Athenians at a time
when their situation could ill bear it, the collateral damage
and peril growing out of the capture of Plemmyrium was yet more
serious, besides the alarm and discouragement which it spread<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[p. 293]</span> among the army. The
Syracusans were now masters of the mouth of the harbor on both
sides, so that not a single storeship could enter without a convoy
and a battle. What was of not less detriment, the Athenian fleet
was now forced to take station under the fortified lines of its own
land-force, and was thus cramped up on a small space in the innermost
portion of the Great Harbor, between the city-wall and the river
Anapus; the Syracusans being masters everywhere else, with full
communication between their posts all round, hemming in the Athenian
position both by sea and by land.</p>

<p>To the Syracusans, on the contrary, the result of the recent
battle proved every way encouraging; not merely from the valuable
acquisition of Plemmyrium, but even from the sea-fight itself, which
had indeed turned out to be a defeat, but which promised at first
to be a victory, had they not thrown away the chance by their own
disorder. It removed all superstitious fear of Athenian nautical
superiority; while their position was so much improved by having
acquired the command of the mouth of the harbor, that they began even
to assume the aggressive at sea. They detached a squadron of twelve
triremes to the coast of Italy, for the purpose of intercepting some
merchant vessels coming with a supply of money to the Athenians. So
little fear was there of an enemy at sea, that these vessels seem to
have been coming without convoy, and were for the most part destroyed
by the Syracusans, together with a stock of ship-timber which the
Athenians had collected near Kaulonia. In touching at Lokri, on their
return, they took aboard a company of Thespian hoplites who had made
their way thither in a transport. They were also fortunate enough
to escape the squadron of twenty triremes which Nikias detached
to lie in wait for them near Megara, with the loss of one ship,
however, including her crew.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427"
class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>One of this Syracusan squadron had gone forward from Italy with
envoys to Peloponnesus, to communicate the favorable news of the
capture of Plemmyrium, and to accelerate as much as possible, the
operations against Attica, in order that no reinforcements might
be sent from thence. At the same time, other envoys went from
Syracuse—not merely Syracusans, but also<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_294">[p. 294]</span> Corinthians and Lacedæmonians—to visit
the cities in the interior of Sicily. They made known everywhere
the prodigious improvement in Syracusan affairs arising from the
gain of Plemmyrium, as well as the insignificant character of the
recent naval defeat. They strenuously pleaded for farther aid to
Syracuse without delay, since there were now the best hopes of
being able to crush the Athenians in the harbor completely, before
the reinforcements about to be despatched could reach them.<a
id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>While these envoys were absent on their mission, the Great
Harbor was the scene of much desultory conflict, though not of any
comprehensive single battle. Since the loss of Plemmyrium, the
Athenian naval station was in the northwest interior corner of that
harbor, adjoining the fortified lines occupied by their land-army.
It was inclosed and protected by a row of posts or stakes stuck
in the bottom and standing out of the water.<a id="FNanchor_429"
href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> The Syracusans on
their side had also planted a stockade in front of the interior port
of Ortygia, to defend their ships, their ship-houses, and their docks
within. As the two stations were not far apart, each party watched
for opportunities of occasional attack or annoyance by missile
weapons to the other; and daily skirmishes of this sort took place,
in which on the whole the Athenians seem to have had the advantage.
They even formed the plan of breaking through the outworks of the
Syracusan dockyard, and burning the ships within. They brought up
a ship of the largest size, with wooden towers and side defences,
against the line of posts fronting the dockyard, and tried to force
the entrance, either by means of divers, who sawed them through at
the bottom, or by boat-crews, who fastened ropes round them and thus
unfixed or plucked them out. All this was done under cover of the
great vessel with its towers manned by light-armed, who exchanged
showers of missiles with the Syracusan bowmen on the top of the
ship-houses, and prevented the latter from coming near enough to
interrupt the operation. The Athenians contrived thus to remove many
of the posts planted, even the most dangerous among them, those which
did not reach to the surface of the water, and which therefore a
ship approaching could not see. But they gained little by it, since
the Syracusans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[p. 295]</span>
were able to plant others in their room. On the whole, no serious
damage was done, either to the dockyard or to the ships within.
And the state of affairs in the Great Harbor stood substantially
unaltered, during all the time that the envoys were absent on their
Sicilian tour, probably three weeks or a month.<a id="FNanchor_430"
href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>These envoys had found themselves almost everywhere well received.
The prospects of Syracuse were now so triumphant, and those of Nikias
with his present force so utterly hopeless, that the waverers thought
it time to declare themselves; and all the Greek cities in Sicily,
except Agrigentum, which still remained neutral (and of course
except Naxos and Katana), resolved on aiding the winning cause.
From Kamarina came five hundred hoplites, four hundred darters,
and three hundred bowmen; from Gela, five triremes, four hundred
darters, and two hundred horsemen. Besides these, an additional
force from the other cities was collected, to march to Syracuse
in a body across the interior of the island, under the conduct of
the envoys themselves. But this part of the scheme was frustrated
by Nikias, who was rendered more vigilant by the present desperate
condition of his affairs, than he had been in reference to the cross
march of Gylippus. At his instance, the Sikel tribes Kentoripes
and Halikyæi, allies of Athens, were prevailed upon to attack the
approaching enemy. They planned a skilful ambuscade, set upon them
unawares, and dispersed them with the loss of eight hundred men. All
the envoys were also slain, except the Corinthian, who conducted the
remaining force, about fifteen hundred in number, to Syracuse.<a
id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>This reverse—which seems to have happened about the time when
Demosthenês with his armament were at Korkyra, on the way to
Syracuse—so greatly dismayed and mortified the Syracusans, that
Gylippus thought it advisable to postpone awhile the attack which he
intended to have made immediately on the reinforcement arriving.<a
id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> The
delay of these few days proved nothing less than the salvation of the
Athenian army.</p>

<p>It was not until Demosthenês was approaching Rhegium within two
or three days’ sail of Syracuse, that the attack was determined
on without farther delay. Preparation in every way had been<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[p. 296]</span> made for it long
before, especially for the most effective employment of the naval
force. The captains and ship-masters of Syracuse and Corinth had now
become fully aware of the superiority of Athenian nautical manœuvre,
and of the causes upon which that superiority depended. The Athenian
trireme was of a build comparatively light, fit for rapid motion
through the water, and for easy change of direction: its prow was
narrow, armed with a sharp projecting beak at the end, but hollow and
thin, not calculated to force its way through very strong resistance.
It was never intended to meet, in direct impact and collision, the
prow of an enemy: such a proceeding passed among the able seamen of
Athens for gross awkwardness. In advancing against an enemy’s vessel,
they evaded the direct shock, steered so as to pass by it, then, by
the excellence and exactness of their rowing, turned swiftly round,
altered their direction and came back before the enemy could alter
his: or perhaps rowed rapidly round him, or backed their ship stern
foremost, until the opportunity was found for driving the beak of
their ship against some weak part of his, against the midships, the
quarter, the stern, or the oarblades without. In such manœuvres the
Athenians were unrivalled: but none such could be performed unless
there were ample sea-room, which rendered their present naval station
the most disadvantageous that could be imagined. They were cooped
up in the inmost part of a harbor of small dimensions, close on
the station of their enemies, and with all the shore, except their
own lines, in possession of those enemies: so that they could not
pull round from want of space, nor could they back water, because
they durst not come near shore. In this contracted area, the only
mode of fighting possible was by straightforward collision, prow
against prow; a process which not only shut out all their superior
manœuvring, but was unsuited to the build of their triremes. On the
other hand, the Syracusans, under the advice of the able Corinthian
steersman Aristo, altered the construction of their triremes to
meet the special exigency of the case, disregarding all idea of
what had been generally looked upon as good nautical manœuvring.<a
id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
Instead of the long, thin, hollow, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_297">[p. 297]</span> sharp, advancing beak, striking the
enemy considerably above the water-level, and therefore doing less
damage, they shortened the prow, but made it excessively heavy and
solid, and lowered the elevation of the projecting beak: so that
it became not so much calculated to pierce, as to break in and
crush by main force all the opposing part of the enemy’s ship, not
far above the water. What were called the epôtids, “ear-caps,” or
nozzles, projecting forwards to the right and left of the beak, were
made peculiarly thick, and sustained by under-beams let in to the
hull of the ship. In the Attic build, the beak stood forward very
prominent, and the epôtids on each side of it were kept back, serving
the same purpose as what are called catheads, in modern ships, to
which the anchors are suspended: but in the Corinthian build, the
beak projected less, and the epôtids more, so that they served to
strike the enemy: instead of having one single beak, the Corinthian
ship might be said to have three nozzles.<a id="FNanchor_434"
href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> The Syracusans
relied on the narrowness of the space, for shutting out the Athenian
evolutions, and bringing the contest to nothing more than a
straightforward collision; in which the weaker vessel would be broken
and stove in at the prow, and thus rendered unmanageable.</p>

<p>Having completed these arrangements, their land-force was<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[p. 298]</span> marched out under
Gylippus to threaten one side of the Athenian lines, while the
cavalry and the garrison of the Olympieion marched up to the other
side. The Athenians were putting themselves in position to defend
their walls from what seemed to be a land attack, when they saw the
Syracusan fleet, eighty triremes strong, sailing out from its dock
prepared for action: upon which they too, though at first confused by
this unexpected appearance, put their crews on shipboard, and went
out of their palisaded station, seventy-five triremes in number,
to meet the enemy. The whole day passed off, however, in desultory
and indecisive skirmish, with trifling advantage to the Syracusans,
who disabled one or two Athenian ships, yet merely tried to invite
the Athenians to attack, without choosing themselves to force on a
close and general action.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435"
class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>It was competent to the Athenians to avoid altogether a naval
action, at least until the necessity arose for escorting fresh
supplies into the harbor, by keeping within their station; and as
Demosthenês was now at hand, prudence counselled this reserve. Nikias
himself, too, is said to have deprecated immediate fighting, but to
have been outvoted by his two newly-appointed colleagues Menander
and Euthydemus, who were anxious to show what they could do without
Demosthenês, and took their stand upon Athenian maritime honor, which
peremptorily forbade them to shrink from the battle when offered.<a
id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>Though on the next day the Syracusans made no movement, yet
Nikias foreseeing that they would speedily recommence, and noway
encouraged by the equal manifestations of the preceding day, caused
every trierarch to repair what damage his ship had sustained, and
even took the precaution of farther securing his naval station
by mooring merchant-vessels just alongside of the openings in
the palisade, about two hundred feet apart. The prows of these
vessels were provided with dolphins, or beams lifted up on high
and armed at the end with massive heads of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_299">[p. 299]</span> iron, which could be so let fall as to
crush any ship entering:<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437"
class="fnanchor">[437]</a> any Athenian trireme which might be
hard-pressed, would thus be enabled to get through this opening
where no enemy could follow, and choose her own time for sailing
out again. Before night these arrangements were completed, and at
the earliest dawn of next day, the Syracusans reappeared, with the
same demonstrations both of land force and naval force as before.
The Athenian fleet having gone forth to meet them, several hours
were spent in the like indecisive and partial skirmishes, until at
length the Syracusan fleet sailed back to the city again without
bringing on any general or close combat. The Athenians, construing
this retirement of the enemy as evidence of backwardness and
unwillingness to fight,<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438"
class="fnanchor">[438]</a> and supposing the day’s duty at an end,
retired on their side within their own station, disembarked, and
separated to get their dinners at leisure, having tasted no food that
day.</p>

<p>But ere they had been long ashore, they were astonished to see
the Syracusan fleet sailing back to renew the attack, in full
battle order. This was a manœuvre suggested by the Corinthian
Aristo, the ablest steersman in the fleet; at whose instance,
the Syracusan admirals had sent back an urgent request to the
city authorities, that an abundant stock of provisions might for
that day be brought down to the sea-shore, and sale be rendered
compulsory; so that no time should be lost, when the fleet returned
thither, in taking a hasty meal without dispersion of the crews.
Accordingly the fleet, after a short but sufficient interval
allowed for refreshment thus close at hand, was brought back
unexpectedly to the enemy’s station. Confounded at the sight, the
Athenian crews forced themselves again on board, most of them yet
without refreshment, and in the midst of murmurs and disorder.<a
id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>
On sailing out of their station, the indecisive skirmishing again
com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[p. 300]</span>menced, and
continued for some time, until at length the Athenian captains
became so impatient of prolonged and exhausting fatigue, that they
resolved to begin of themselves, and make the action close as well
as general. Accordingly, the word of command was given, and they
rowed forward to make the attack, which was cheerfully received by
the Syracusans. By receiving the attack instead of making it, the
latter were better enabled to insure a straightforward collision of
prow against prow, excluding all circuit, backing, or evolutions,
on the part of the enemy: at any rate, their steersmen contrived to
realize this plan, and to crush, stave in, or damage, the forepart of
many of the Athenian triremes, simply by superior weight of material
and solidity on their own side. The Syracusan darters on the deck,
moreover, as soon as the combat became close, were both numerous and
destructive; while their little boats rowed immediately under the
sides of the Athenian triremes, broke the blades of their oars, and
shot darts in through the oar-holes, against the rowers within. At
length the Athenians, after sustaining the combat bravely for some
time, found themselves at such disadvantage, that they were compelled
to give way and to seek shelter within their own station. The armed
merchant-vessels which Nikias had planted before the openings in
the palisade were now found of great use in checking the pursuing
Syracusans; two of whose triremes, in the excitement of victory,
pushed forward too near to them and were disabled by the heavy
implements on board, one of them being captured with all her crew.
The general victory of the Syracusans, however, was complete: seven
Athenian triremes were sunk or disabled, many others were seriously
damaged, and numbers of seamen either slain or made prisoners.<a
id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>Overjoyed with the result of this battle, which seems to have
been no less skilfully planned than bravely executed, the Syracusans
now felt confident of their superiority by sea as well as on land,
and contemplated nothing less than the complete destruction of
their enemies in the harbor. The generals were already concerting
measures for renewed attack both by land and by sea, and a week or
two more would probably have seen the ruin of this once triumphant
besieging armament, now full of nothing but<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_301">[p. 301]</span> discouragement. The mere stoppage of
supplies, in fact, as the Syracusans were masters of the mouth of
the harbor, would be sure to starve it out in no long time, if they
maintained their superiority at sea. All their calculations were
suspended, however, and the hopes of the Athenians for the time
revived, by the entry of Demosthenês and Eurymedon with the second
armament into the Great Harbor; which seems to have taken place
on the very day, or on the second day, after the recent battle.<a
id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> So
important were the consequences which turned upon that postponement
of the Syracusan attack, occasioned by the recent defeat of their
reinforcing army from the interior. So little did either party think,
at that moment, that it would have been a mitigation of calamity to
Athens, if Demosthenês had <i>not</i> arrived in time; if the ruin of the
first armament had been actually consummated before the coming of the
second!</p>

<p>Demosthenês, after obtaining the required reinforcements at
Korkyra, had crossed the Ionian sea to the islands called Chœrades
on the coast of Iapygia; where he took aboard a band of one hundred
and fifty Messapian darters, through the friendly aid of the native
prince Artas, with whom an ancient alliance was renewed. Passing on
farther to Metapontum, already in alliance with Athens, he was there
reinforced with two triremes and three hundred darters, with which
addition he sailed on to Thurii. Here he found himself cordially
welcomed; for the philo-Athenian party was in full ascendency, having
recently got the better in a vehement dissension, and passed a
sentence of banishment against their opponents.<a id="FNanchor_442"
href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> They not only took
a formal resolution to acknowledge the same friends and the same
enemies as the Athenians, but equipped a regiment of seven hundred
hoplites and three hundred darters to accompany Demosthenês, who
remained there long enough to pass his troops in review and verify
the completeness of each division. After having held this review
on the banks of the river Sybaris, he marched his troops by land
through the Thurian territory to the banks of the river Hylias which
divided it from Kroton. He was here met by Krotoniate envoys, who
forbade the access to their territory: upon which he marched down the
river to the sea-shore, got on shipboard, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_302">[p. 302]</span> pursued his voyage southward along
the coast of Italy, touching at the various towns, all except
the hostile Lokri.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443"
class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>His entry into the harbor of Syracuse,<a id="FNanchor_444"
href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> accomplished in the
most ostentatious trim, with decorations and musical accompaniments,
was no less imposing from the magnitude of his force than critical
in respect to opportunity. Taking Athenians, allies, and mercenary
forces, together, he conducted seventy-three triremes, five
thousand hoplites, and a large number of light troops of every
description,—archers, slingers, darters, etc., with other requisites
for effective operation. At the sight of such an armament, not
inferior to the first which had arrived under Nikias, the Syracusans
lost for a moment the confidence of their recent triumph, and
were struck with dismay as well as wonder.<a id="FNanchor_445"
href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> That Athens could
be rash enough to spare such an armament, at a moment when the full
burst of Peloponnesian hostility was reopening upon her, and when
Dekeleia was in course of being fortified, was a fact out of all
reasonable probability, and not to be credited unless actually seen.
And probably the Syracusans, though they knew that Demosthenês was on
his way, had no idea beforehand of the magnitude of his armament.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the hearts of the discomfited and beleaguered
Athenians again revived as they welcomed their new comrades. They
saw themselves again masters by land as well as by sea; and they
displayed their renewed superiority by marching out of their lines
forthwith and ravaging the lands near the Anapus; the Syracusans not
venturing to engage in a general action, and merely watching the
movement with some cavalry from the Olympieion.</p>

<p>But Demosthenês was not imposed upon by this delusive show of
power, so soon as he had made himself master of the full state
of affairs, and had compared his own means with those of the
enemy. He found the army of Nikias not merely worn down with
long-continued toil, and disheartened by previous defeat, but also
weakened in a terrible degree by the marsh fever general towards
the close of summer, in the low ground where they were encamped.<a
id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[p. 303]</span></p>

<p>He saw that the Syracusans were strong in multiplied allies,
extended fortifications, a leader of great ability, and general
belief that theirs was the winning cause. Moreover, he felt deeply
the position of Athens at home, and her need of all her citizens
against enemies within sight of her own walls. But above all, he
came penetrated with the deplorable effects which had resulted from
the mistake of Nikias, in wasting irreparably so much precious time,
and frittering away the first terror-striking impression of his
splendid armament. All these considerations determined Demosthenês
to act, without a moment’s delay and while the impression produced
by his arrival was yet unimpaired, and to aim one great and decisive
blow, such as might, if successful, make the conquest of Syracuse
again probable. If this should fail, he resolved to abandon the
whole enterprise, and return home with his armament forthwith.<a
id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>By means of the Athenian lines, he had possession of the
southernmost portion of the slope of Epipolæ. But all along that
slope from east to west, immediately in front or to the north of
his position, stretched the counter-wall built by the Syracusans;
beginning at the city wall on the lowest ground, and reaching up
first in a northwesterly, next in a westerly direction, until it
joined the fort on the upper ground near the cliff, where the road
from Euryalus down to Syracuse passed. The Syracusans, as defenders,
were on the north side of this counter-wall; he and the Athenians
on the south side. It was a complete bar to his progress, nor could
he stir a step without making himself master of it: towards which
end there were only two possible means,—either to storm it in front,
or to turn it from its western extremity by marching round up to
the Euryalus. He began by trying the first method; but the wall was
abundantly manned and vigorously defended; his battering machines
were all burnt or disqualified, and every attempt which he made
was completely repulsed.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448"
class="fnanchor">[448]</a> There then remained only the second
method, to turn the wall, ascending by circuitous roads to the
heights of Euryalus behind it, and then attacking the fort in which
it terminated.</p>

<p>But the march necessary for this purpose, first, up the valley
of the Anapus, visible from the Syracusan posts above; next,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[p. 304]</span> ascending to the
Euryalus by a narrow and winding path, was so difficult, that even
Demosthenês, naturally sanguine, despaired of being able to force his
way up in the daylight, against an enemy seeing the attack. He was
therefore constrained to attempt a night-surprise, for which, Nikias
and his other colleagues consenting, he accordingly made preparations
on the largest and most effective scale. He took the command
himself, along with Menander and Eurymedon (Nikias being left to
command within the lines),<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449"
class="fnanchor">[449]</a> conducting hoplites and light troops,
together with masons and carpenters, and all other matters necessary
for establishing a fortified post; lastly, giving orders that every
man should carry with him provisions for five days.</p>

<p>Fortune so far favored him, that not only all these preliminary
arrangements, but even his march itself, was accomplished without
any suspicion of the enemy. At the beginning of a moonlight night,
he quitted the lines, moved along the low ground on the left
bank of the Anapus and parallel to that river for a considerable
distance, then following various roads to the right, arrived at
the Euryalus, or highest pitch of Epipolæ, where he found himself
in the same track by which the Athenians in coming from Katana a
year and a half before—and Gylippus in coming from the interior
of the island about ten months before—had passed, in order to get
to the slope of Epipolæ above Syracuse. He reached, without being
discovered, the extreme Syracusan fort on the high ground, assailed
it completely by surprise, and captured it after a feeble resistance.
Some of the garrison within it were slain; but the greater part
escaped, and ran to give the alarm to the three fortified camps of
Syracusans and allies, which were placed one below another behind
the long continuous wall,<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450"
class="fnanchor">[450]</a> on the declivity of Epipolæ, as well as
to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[p. 305]</span> chosen
regiment of six hundred Syracusan hoplites under Hermokratês,<a
id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>
who formed a night-watch, or bivouac. This regiment hastened up
to the rescue, but Demosthenês and the Athenian vanguard charging
impetuously forward, drove them back in disorder upon the fortified
positions in their rear. Even Gylippus and the Syracusan troops
advancing upwards out of these positions, were at first carried back
by the same retreating movement.</p>

<p>So far the enterprise of Demosthenês had been successful beyond
all reasonable hope. He was master not only of the outer fort
of the Syracusan position, but also of the extremity of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[p. 306]</span> their counter-wall
which rested upon that fort; the counter-wall was no longer
defensible, now that he had got on the north or Syracusan side of
it, so that the men on the parapet, where it joined the fort, made
no resistance, and fled. Some of the Athenians even began to tear
down the parapets, and demolish this part of the counter-wall,
an operation of extreme importance, since it would have opened
to Demosthenês a communication with the southern side of the
counter-wall, leading directly towards the Athenian lines on
Epipolæ. At any rate, his plan of turning the counter-wall was
already carried, if he could only have maintained himself in his
actual position, even without advancing farther, and if he could
have demolished two or three hundred yards of the upper extremity
of the wall now in his power. Whether it would have been possible
for him to maintain himself without farther advance, until day
broke, and thus avoid the unknown perils of a night-battle, we
cannot say. But both he and his men, too much flushed with success
to think of halting, hastened forward to complete their victory,
and to prevent the disordered Syracusans from again recovering a
firm array. Unfortunately, however, their ardor of pursuit—as it
constantly happened with Grecian hoplites—disturbed the regularity
of their own ranks, so that they were not in condition to stand the
shock of the Bœotian hoplites, just emerged from their position, and
marching up in steady and excellent order to the scene of action.
The Bœotians charged them, and after a short resistance, broke them
completely, forcing them to take flight. The fugitives of the van
were thus driven back upon their own comrades advancing from behind,
still under the impression of success, ignorant of what had passed
in front, and themselves urged on by the fresh troops closing up in
their rear.</p>

<p>In this manner the whole army presently became one scene of clamor
and confusion wherein there was neither command nor obedience,
nor could any one discern what was passing. The light of the moon
rendered objects and figures generally visible, without being
sufficient to discriminate friend from foe. The beaten Athenians,
thrown back upon their comrades, were in many cases mistaken for
enemies, and slain. The Syracusans and Bœotians, shouting aloud and
pursuing their advantage, became intermingled with the foremost
Athenians, and both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[p.
307]</span> armies thus grouped into knots which only distinguished
each other by mutual demand of the watchword. This test also soon
failed, since each party got acquainted with the watchword of the
other, especially that of the Athenians, among whom the confusion was
the greatest, became well known to the Syracusans, who kept together
in larger parties. Above all, the effect of the pæan or war-shout
on both sides was remarkable. The Dorians in the Athenian army—from
Argos, Korkyra, and other places—raised a pæan not distinguishable
from that of the Syracusans; accordingly, their shout struck terror
into the Athenians themselves, who fancied that they had enemies in
their own rear and centre. Such disorder and panic presently ended
in a general flight. The Athenians hurried back by the same roads
which they had ascended; but these roads were found too narrow for
terrified fugitives, and many of them threw away their arms in order
to scramble or jump down the cliffs, in which most of them perished.
Even of those who safely effected their descent into the plain
below, many—especially the new-comers belonging to the armament of
Demosthenês—lost their way through ignorance, and were cut off the
next day by the Syracusan horse. With terrible loss of numbers, and
broken spirit, the Athenians at length found shelter within their own
lines. Their loss of arms was even greater than that of men, from the
throwing away of shields by those soldiers who leaped the cliff.<a
id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>The overjoyed Syracusans erected two trophies, one upon the road
to Epipolæ, the other upon the exact and critical spot where the
Bœotians had first withstood and first repelled the enemy. By this
unexpected and overwhelming victory, their feelings were restored
to the same pitch of confidence which had animated them before the
arrival of Demosthenês. Again now masters of the field, they again
indulged the hope of storming the Athenian lines and destroying
the armament; to which end, however, it was thought necessary to
obtain additional reinforcements, and Gylippus went in person with
this commission to the various cities of Sicily, while Sikanus with
fifteen triremes was despatched to Agrigentum, then understood
to be wavering, and in a political crisis.<a id="FNanchor_453"
href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[p. 308]</span></p> <p>During this
absence of Gylippus, the Athenian generals were left to mourn the
recent reverse, and to discuss the exigencies of their untoward
position. The whole armament was now full of discouragement and
weariness; impatient to escape from a scene where fever daily
thinned their numbers, and where they seemed destined to nothing but
dishonor. Such painful evidences of increasing disorganization only
made Demosthenês more strenuous in enforcing the resolution which
he had taken before the attack on Epipolæ. He had done his best to
strike one decisive blow; the chances of war had turned out against
him, and inflicted a humiliating defeat; he now therefore insisted
on relinquishing the whole enterprise and returning home forthwith.
The season was yet favorable for the voyage (it seems to have been
the beginning of August), while the triremes recently brought, as
yet unused, rendered them masters at sea for the present. It was
idle, he added, to waste more time and money in staying to carry
on war against Syracuse, which they could not now hope to subdue,
especially when Athens had so much need of them all at home, against
the garrison of Dekeleia.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454"
class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>This proposition, though espoused and seconded by Eurymedon,
was peremptorily opposed by Nikias; who contended, first, that
their present distress and the unpromising chances for the future,
though he admitted the full reality of both, ought not nevertheless
to be publicly proclaimed. A formal resolution to retire, passed
in the presence of so many persons, would inevitably become
known to the enemy, and therefore could never be executed with
silence and secrecy,<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455"
class="fnanchor">[455]</a> as such a resolution ought to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[p. 309]</span> be. But farthermore, he
(Nikias) took a decided objection to the resolution itself. He would
never consent to carry back the armament, without specific authority
from home to do so. Sure he was, that the Athenian people would never
tolerate such a proceeding. When submitted to the public assembly at
home, the conduct of the generals would be judged, not by persons
who had been at Syracuse and cognizant of the actual facts, but by
hearers who would learn all that they knew from the artful speeches
of criminative orators. Even the citizens actually serving, though
now loud in cries of suffering, and impatient to get home, would
alter their tone when they were safe in the public assembly; and
would turn round to denounce their generals as having been bribed to
bring away the army. Speaking his own personal feelings, he knew too
well the tempers of his countrymen to expose himself to the danger
of thus perishing under a charge alike unmerited and disgraceful.
Sooner would he incur any extremity of risk from the enemy.<a
id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> It
must be recollected too, he added, that if <i>their</i> affairs were now
bad, those of Syracuse were as bad, and even worse. For more than a
year, the war had been imposing upon the Syracusans a ruinous cost,
in subsistence for foreign allies as well as in keeping up outlying
posts; so that they had already spent two thousand talents, besides
heavy debts contracted and not paid. They could not continue in
this course longer; yet the suspension of their payments would at
once alienate their allies, and leave them helpless. The cost of
the war—to which Demosthenês had alluded as a reason for returning
home—could be much better borne by Athens; while a little farther
pressure would utterly break down the Syr<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_310">[p. 310]</span>acusans. He (Nikias) therefore advised
to remain where they were and continue the siege;<a id="FNanchor_457"
href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> the more so, as their
fleet had now become unquestionably the superior.</p>

<p>Both Demosthenês and Eurymedon protested in the strongest language
against the proposition of Nikias. Especially they treated the plan
of remaining in the Great Harbor as fraught with ruin, and insisted,
at the very least, on quitting this position without a moment’s
delay. Even admitting, for argument, the scruples of Nikias against
abandoning the Syracusan war without formal authority from home,
they still urged an immediate transfer of their camp from the Great
Harbor to Thapsus or Katana. At either of these stations they could
prosecute operations against Syracuse, with all the advantage of a
wider range of country for supplies, a healthier spot, and above
all, of an open sea, which was absolutely indispensable to the
naval tactics of Athenians; escaping from that narrow basin which
condemned them to inferiority even on their own proper element. At
all events to remove, and remove forthwith, out of the Great Harbor,
such was the pressing requisition of Demosthenês and Eurymedon.<a
id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>But even to the modified motion of transferring the actual
position to Thapsus or Katana, Nikias refused to consent.
He insisted on remaining as they were; and it appears that
Menander and Euthydemus<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459"
class="fnanchor">[459]</a>—colleagues named by the assembly at home,
before the departure of the second armament—must have voted under the
influence of his authority; whereby the majority became on his side.
Nothing less than being in a minority, probably, would have induced
Demosthenês and Eurymedon to submit, on a point of such transcendent
importance.</p>

<p>It was thus that the Athenian armament remained without quitting
the harbor, yet apparently quite inactive, during a period which
cannot have been less than between three weeks and a month,
until Gylippus returned to Syracuse with fresh reinforcements.
Throughout the army, hope of success appears<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_311">[p. 311]</span> to have vanished, while anxiety for
return had become general. The opinions of Demosthenês and Eurymedon
were doubtless well known, and orders for retreat were expected, but
never came. Nikias obstinately refused to give them, during the whole
of this fatal interval; which plunged the army into the abyss of
ruin, instead of mere failure in their aggressive enterprise.</p>

<p>So unaccountable did such obstinacy appear, that many persons
gave Nikias credit for knowing more than he chose to reveal. Even
Thucydidês thinks that he was misled by that party in Syracuse with
whom he had always kept up a secret correspondence, seemingly apart
from his colleagues, and who still urged him, by special messages,
not to go away; assuring him that Syracuse could not possibly go on
longer. Without fully trusting these intimations, he could not bring
himself to act against them; and he therefore hung back from day to
day, and refused to pronounce the decisive word.<a id="FNanchor_460"
href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>Nothing throughout the whole career of Nikias is so inexplicable
as his guilty fatuity—for we can call it by no lighter name, seeing
that it involved all the brave men around him in one common ruin with
himself—at the present critical juncture. How can we suppose him
to have really believed that the Syracusans, now in the flood-tide
of success, and when Gylippus was gone forth to procure additional
forces, would break down and be unable to carry on the war? Childish
as such credulity seems, we are nevertheless compelled to admit
it as real, to such an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[p.
312]</span> extent as to counterbalance all the pressing motives for
departure, motives enforced by discerning colleagues as well as by
the complaints of the army, and brought home to his own observation
by the experience of the late naval defeat. At any rate, it served
as an excuse for that fatal weakness of his character which made him
incapable of taking resolutions founded on prospective calculations,
and chained him to his actual position until he was driven to act by
imminent necessity.</p>

<p>But we discern on the present occasion another motive, which
counts for much in dictating his hesitation. The other generals think
with satisfaction of going back to their country and rescuing the
force which yet remained, even under circumstances of disappointment
and failure. Not so Nikias: he knows too well the reception which
he had deserved, and which might possibly be in store for him.
Avowedly, indeed, he anticipates reproach from the Athenians against
the generals, but only unmerited reproach, on the special ground
of bringing away the army without orders from home; adding some
harsh criticisms upon the injustice of the popular judgment and
the perfidy of his own soldiers. But in the first place, we may
remark, that Demosthenês and Eurymedon, though as much responsible
as he was for this decision, had no such fear of popular injustice;
or, if they had, saw clearly that the obligation of braving it was
here imperative. And in the next place, no man ever had so little
reason to complain of the popular judgment as Nikias. The mistakes
of the people in regard to him had always been those of indulgence,
over-esteem, and over-constancy. But Nikias foresaw too well that
he would have more to answer for at Athens than the simple fact
of sanctioning retreat under existing circumstances. He could
not but remember the pride and sanguine hopes under which he had
originally conducted the expedition out of Peiræus, contrasted with
the miserable sequel and ignominious close, even if the account had
been now closed, without worse. He could not but be conscious, more
or less, how much of all this was owing to his own misjudgment; and
under such impressions, the idea of meeting the free criticisms
and scrutiny of his fellow-citizens—even putting aside the chance
of judicial trial—must have been insupportably humiliating. To
Nikias,—a perfectly brave man, and suffering withal under an<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[p. 313]</span> incurable disease,—life
at Athens had neither charm nor honor left. Hence, as much as from
any other reason, he was induced to withhold the order for departure;
clinging to the hope that some unforeseen boon of fortune might yet
turn up, and yielding to the idlest delusions from correspondents in
the interior of Syracuse.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461"
class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>Nearly a month after the night-battle on Epipolæ,<a
id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>
Gylippus and Sikanus both returned to Syracuse. The latter had been
unsuccessful at Agrigentum, where the philo-Syracusan party had been
sent into banishment before his arrival; but Gylippus brought with
him a considerable force of Sicilian Greeks, together with those
Peloponnesian hoplites who had started from Cape Tænarus in the early
spring, and who had made their way from Kyrênê first along the coast
of Africa, and then across to Selinus. Such increase of strength
immediately determined the Syracusans to resume the aggressive both
by land and by sea. In the Athenians, as they saw the new allies
marching in over Epipolæ, it produced a deeper despondency, combined
with bitter regret that they had not adopted the proposition of
departing immediately after the battle of Epipolæ, when Demosthenês
first proposed it. The late interval of lingering hopeless inaction
with continued sickness, had farther weakened their strength,
and Demosthenês now again pressed the resolution for immediate
departure. Whatever fancies Nikias may have indulged about Syracusan
embarrassments, were dissipated by the arrival of Gylippus; nor did
he venture to persist in his former peremptory opposition, though
even now he seems to have assented against his own conviction.<a
id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>
He however insisted, with good reason, that no formal or public
vote should be taken on the occasion, but that the order<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[p. 314]</span> should be circulated
through the camp, as privately as possible, to be ready for
departure at a given signal. Intimation was sent to Katana that the
armament was on the point of coming away, with orders to forward
no farther supplies.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464"
class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>This plan was proceeding successfully: the ships were made ready,
much of the property of the army had already been conveyed aboard
without awakening the suspicion of the enemy, the signal would have
been hoisted on the ensuing morning, and within a few hours this
fated armament would have found itself clear of the harbor, with
comparatively small loss,<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465"
class="fnanchor">[465]</a> when the gods themselves—I speak in the
language and feelings of the Athenian camp—interfered to forbid
its departure. On the very night before, the 27th August, 413
<small>B.C.</small>, which was full moon, the moon
was eclipsed. Such a portent, impressive to the Athenians at all
times, was doubly so under their present despondency, and many of
them construed it as a divine prohibition against departure until
a certain time should have elapsed, with expiatory ceremonies to
take off the effect. They made known their wish for postponement to
Nikias and his colleagues; but their interference was superfluous,
for Nikias himself was more deeply affected than any one else.
He consulted the prophets, who declared that the army ought not
to decamp until thrice nine days, a full circle of the moon,
should have passed over.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466"
class="fnanchor">[466]</a> And Nikias took upon himself to announce,
that until after the inter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[p.
315]</span>val indicated by them, he would not permit even any
discussion or proposition on the subject.</p>

<p>The decision of the prophets, which Nikias thus made his own,
was a sentence of death to the Athenian army, yet it went along
with the general feeling, and was obeyed without hesitation. Even
Demosthenês, though if he had commanded alone, he might have tried
to overrule it, found himself compelled to yield. Yet according to
Philochorus, himself a professional diviner, skilful in construing
the religious meaning of events, it was a decision decidedly wrong;
that is, wrong according to the canonical principles of divination.
To men planning escape, or any other operation requiring silence
and secrecy, an eclipse of the moon, as hiding light and producing
darkness, was, he affirmed, an encouraging sign, and ought to have
made the Athenians even more willing and forward in quitting the
harbor. We are told, too, that Nikias had recently lost by death
Stilbidês, the ablest prophet in his service, and that he was
thus forced to have recourse to prophets of inferior ability.<a
id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>
His piety left no means untried of appeasing the gods, by prayer,
sacrifice, and expiatory ceremonies, continued until the necessity
of actual conflict arrived.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468"
class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>The impediment thus finally and irreparably intercepting the
Athenian departure, was the direct, though unintended, consequence
of the delay previously caused by Nikias. We cannot doubt, however,
that, when the eclipse first happened, he regarded it as a sign
confirmatory of the opinion which he had himself before delivered,
and that he congratulated himself upon having so long resisted the
proposition for going away. Let us add, that all those Athenians
who were predisposed to look upon eclipses as signs from heaven of
calamity about to come, would find themselves strengthened in that
belief by the unparalleled woes even now impending over this unhappy
army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[p. 316]</span></p>

<p>What interpretation the Syracusans, confident and victorious,
put on the eclipse, we are not told. But they knew well how to
interpret the fact, which speedily came to their knowledge, that the
Athenians had fully resolved to make a furtive escape, and had only
been prevented by the eclipse. Such a resolution, amounting to an
unequivocal confession of helplessness, emboldened the Syracusans
yet farther, to crush them as they were in the harbor, and never to
permit them to occupy even any other post in Sicily. Accordingly,
Gylippus caused his triremes to be manned and practised for several
days: he then drew out his land-force, and made a demonstration of
no great significance against the Athenian lines. On the morrow, he
brought out all his forces, both land and naval; with the former
of which he beset the Athenian lines, while the fleet, seventy-six
triremes in number, was directed to sail up to the Athenian naval
station. The Athenian fleet, eighty-six triremes strong, sailed out
to meet it, and a close, general, and desperate action took place.
The fortune of Athens had fled. The Syracusans first beat the centre
division of the Athenians; next, the right division under Eurymedon,
who in attempting an evolution to outflank the enemy’s left, forgot
those narrow limits of the harbor which were at every turn the ruin
of the Athenian mariner, neared the land too much, and was pinned
up against it, in the recess of Daskon, by the vigorous attack of
the Syracusans. He was here slain, and his division destroyed:
successively, the entire Athenian fleet was beaten and driven
ashore.</p>

<p>Few of the defeated ships could get into their own station.
Most of them were forced ashore or grounded on points without
those limits; upon which Gylippus marched down his land-force to
the water’s edge, in order to prevent the retreat of the crews as
well as to assist the Syracusan seamen in hauling off the ships
as prizes. His march, however, was so hurried and disorderly,
that the Tyrrhenian troops, on guard at the flank of the Athenian
station, sallied out against them as they approached, beat the
foremost of them, and drove them away from the shore into the marsh
called Lysimeleia. More Syracusan troops came to their aid; but the
Athenians also, anxious above all things for the protection of their
ships, came forth in greater numbers; and a general battle ensued in
which the latter were victorious. Though they<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_317">[p. 317]</span> did not inflict much loss upon the
enemy, yet they saved most of their own triremes which had been
driven ashore, together with the crews, and carried them into the
naval station. Except for this success on land, the entire Athenian
fleet would have been destroyed: as it was, the defeat was still
complete, and eighteen triremes were lost, all their crews being
slain. This was probably the division of Eurymedon, which having
been driven ashore in the recess of Daskon, was too far off from the
Athenian station to receive any land assistance. As the Athenians
were hauling in their disabled triremes, the Syracusans made a last
effort to destroy them by means of a fireship, for which the wind
happened to be favorable. But the Athenians found means to prevent
her approach, and to extinguish the flames.<a id="FNanchor_469"
href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>Here was a complete victory gained over Athens on her own
element, gained with inferior numbers, gained even over the fresh
and yet formidable fleet recently brought by Demosthenês. It told
but too plainly on which side the superiority now lay, how well the
Syracusans had organized their naval strength for the specialties
of their own harbor, how ruinous had been the folly of Nikias in
retaining his excellent seamen imprisoned within that petty and
unwholesome lake, where land and water alike did the work of their
enemies. It not only disheartened the Athenians, but belied all
their past experience, and utterly confounded them. Sickness of
the whole enterprise, and repentance for having undertaken it, now
became uppermost in their minds: yet it is remarkable that we hear
of no complaints against Nikias separately.<a id="FNanchor_470"
href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> But repentance came
too late. The Syracusans, fully alive to the importance of their
victory, sailed round the harbor in triumph as again their own,<a
id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>
and already looked on the enemy within it as their prisoners. They
determined to close up and guard the mouth of it, from Plemmyrium to
Ortygia, so as to leave no farther liberty of exit.</p>

<p>Nor were they insensible how vastly the scope of the contest<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[p. 318]</span> was now widened, and
the value of the stake before them enhanced. It was not merely to
rescue their own city from siege, nor even to repel and destroy the
besieging army, that they were now contending. It was to extinguish
the entire power of Athens, and liberate the half of Greece from
dependence; for Athens could never be expected to survive so terrific
a loss as that of the entire double armament before Syracuse.<a
id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>
The Syracusans exulted in the thought that this great achievement
would be theirs, that their city was the field, and their navy the
chief instrument of victory: a lasting source of glory to them, not
merely in the eyes of contemporaries, but even in those of posterity.
Their pride swelled when they reflected on the Pan-Hellenic
importance which the siege of Syracuse had now acquired, and when
they counted up the number and variety of Greek warriors who were now
fighting, on one side or the other, between Euryalus and Plemmyrium.
With the exception of the great struggle between Athens and the
Peloponnesian confederacy, never before had combatants so many
and so miscellaneous been engaged under the same banners. Greeks,
continental and insular, Ionic, Doric, and Æolic, autonomous and
dependent, volunteers and mercenaries, from Miletus and Chios in
the east to Selinus in the west, were all here to be found; and not
merely Greeks, but also the barbaric Sikels, Egestæans, Tyrrhenians,
and Iapygians. If the Lacædemonians, Corinthians, and Bœotians were
fighting on the side of Syracuse, the Argeians and Mantineians, not
to mention the great insular cities, stood in arms against her. The
jumble of kinship among the combatants on both sides, as well as
the cross action of different local antipathies, is put in lively
antithesis by Thucydidês.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473"
class="fnanchor">[473]</a> But amidst so vast an assembled number,
of which they were the chiefs, the paymasters, and the centre of
combination, the Syracusans might well feel a sense of personal
aggrandizement, and a consciousness of the great blow which they were
about to strike, sufficient to exalt them for the time above the
level even of their great Dorian chiefs in Peloponnesus.</p>

<p>It was their first operation, occupying three days, to close
up the mouth of the Great Harbor, which was nearly one mile<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[p. 319]</span> broad, with vessels
of every description, triremes, traders, boats, etc., anchored in
an oblique direction, and chained together.<a id="FNanchor_474"
href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> They at the same time
prepared their naval force with redoubled zeal for the desperate
struggle which they knew to be coming. They then awaited the efforts
of the Athenians, who watched their proceedings with sadness and
anxiety.</p>

<p>Nikias and his colleagues called together the principal officers
to deliberate what was to be done. As they had few provisions
remaining, and had counter-ordered their farther supplies, some
instant and desperate effort was indispensable; and the only point
in debate was, whether they should burn their fleet and retire by
land, or make a fresh maritime exertion to break out of the harbor.
Such had been the impression left by the recent sea-fight, that
many in the camp leaned to the former scheme.<a id="FNanchor_475"
href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> But the generals
resolved upon first trying the latter, and exhausted all their
combinations to give to it the greatest possible effect. They now
evacuated the upper portion of their lines, both on the higher
ground of Epipolæ, and even on the lower ground, such portion as was
nearest to the southern cliff; confining themselves to a limited
fortified space close to the shore, just adequate for their sick,
their wounded, and their stores; in order to spare the necessity
for a large garrison to defend them, and thus leave nearly their
whole force disposable for sea-service. They then made ready every
trireme in the station, which could be rendered ever so imperfectly
seaworthy, constraining every fit man to serve aboard them, without
distinction of age, rank, or country. The triremes were manned with
double crews of soldiers, hoplites as well as bowmen and darters, the
latter mostly Akarnanians; while the hoplites, stationed at the prow
with orders to board the enemy as quickly as possible, were furnished
with grappling-irons to detain the enemy’s ship immediately after
the moment of collision, in order that it might not be withdrawn
and the collision repeated, with all its injurious effects arising
from the strength and massiveness of the Syracusan epôtids. The
best consultation was held with the steersmen as to arrangement and
manœuvres of every trireme, nor was any precaution omitted which the
scanty means at hand allowed. In the well-known<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_320">[p. 320]</span> impossibility of obtaining new
provisions, every man was anxious to hurry on the struggle.<a
id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
But Nikias, as he mustered them on the shore immediately before
going aboard, saw but too plainly that it was the mere stress of
desperation which impelled them; that the elasticity, the disciplined
confidence, the maritime pride, habitual to the Athenians on
shipboard, was extinct, or dimly and faintly burning.</p>

<p>He did his best to revive them, by exhortations unusually emphatic
and impressive. “Recollect (he said) that you too, not less than
the Syracusans, are now fighting for your own safety and for your
country; for it is only by victory in the coming struggle that any
of you can ever hope to see his country again. Yield not to despair
like raw recruits after a first defeat; you, Athenians and allies,
familiar with the unexpected revolutions of war, will hope now for
the fair turn of fortune, and fight with a spirit worthy of the
great force which you see here around you. We generals have now made
effective provision against our two great disadvantages, the narrow
circuit of the harbor, and the thickness of the enemy’s prows.<a
id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
Sad as the necessity is, we have thrown aside all our Athenian skill
and tactics, and have prepared to fight under the conditions forced
upon us by the enemy, a land-battle on shipboard.<a id="FNanchor_478"
href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> It will be for
you to conquer in this last desperate struggle, where there is no
friendly shore to receive you if you give way. You, hoplites on
the deck, as soon as you have the enemy’s trireme in contact, keep
him fast, and relax not until you have swept away his hoplites and
mastered his deck. You, seamen and rowers, must yet keep up your
courage, in spite of this sad failure in our means, and subversion
of our tactics. You are better defended on deck above, and you
have more triremes to help you, than in the recent defeat. Such
of you, as are not Athenian citizens, I entreat to recollect the
valuable privileges which you have hitherto enjoyed from serving in
the navy of Athens. Though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[p.
321]</span> not really citizens, you have been reputed and treated
as such; you have acquired our dialect, you have copied our habits,
and have thus enjoyed the admiration, the imposing station, and
the security, arising from our great empire.<a id="FNanchor_479"
href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> Partaking as you do
freely in the benefits of that empire, do not now betray it to these
Sicilians and Corinthians whom you have so often beaten. For such of
you as <i>are</i> Athenians, I again remind you that Athens has neither
fresh triremes, nor fresh hoplites, to replace those now here.
Unless you are now victorious, her enemies near home will find her
defenceless; and our countrymen there will become slaves to Sparta,
as you will to Syracuse. Recollect, every man of you, that you now
going aboard here are the <i>all</i> of Athens,—her hoplites, her ships,
her entire remaining city, and her splendid name.<a id="FNanchor_480"
href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> Bear up then and
conquer, every man with his best mettle, in this one last struggle,
for Athens as well as yourselves, and on an occasion which will never
return.”</p>

<p>If, in translating the despatch written home ten months before by
Nikias to the people of Athens, we were compelled to remark, that
the greater part of it was the bitterest condemnation of his<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[p. 322]</span> own previous policy as
commander, so we are here carried back, when we find him striving to
palliate the ruinous effects of that confined space of water which
paralyzed the Athenian seamen, to his own obstinate improvidence in
forbidding the egress of the fleet when insisted on by Demosthenês.
His hearers probably were too much absorbed with the terrible
present, to revert to irremediable mistakes of the past. Immediately
on the conclusion of his touching address, the order was given to
go aboard, and the seamen took their places. But when the triremes
were fully manned, and the trierarchs, after superintending the
embarkation, were themselves about to enter and push off, the agony
of Nikias was too great to be repressed. Feeling more keenly than any
man the intensity of this last death-struggle, and the serious, but
inevitable, shortcomings of the armament in its present condition,
he still thought that he had not said enough for the occasion. He
now renewed his appeal personally to the trierarchs, all of them
citizens of rank and wealth at Athens. They were all familiarly
known to him, and he addressed himself to every man separately by
his own name, his father’s name, and his tribe, adjuring him by the
deepest and most solemn motives which could touch the human feelings.
Some he reminded of their own previous glories, others of the
achievements of illustrious ancestors, imploring them not to dishonor
or betray these precious titles: to all alike he recalled the charm
of their beloved country, with its full political freedom and its
unconstrained license of individual agency to every man: to all alike
he appealed in the names of their wives, their children, and their
paternal gods. He cared not for being suspected of trenching upon the
common places of rhetoric: he caught at every topic which could touch
the inmost affections, awaken the inbred patriotism, and rekindle
the abated courage of the officers, whom he was sending forth to
this desperate venture. He at length constrained himself to leave
off, still fancying in his anxiety that he ought to say more, and
proceeded to marshal the land-force for the defence of the lines, as
well as along the shore, where they might render as much service and
as much encouragement as possible to the combatants on shipboard.<a
id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[p. 323]</span></p> <p>Very
different was the spirit prevalent, and very opposite the burning
words uttered, on the seaboard of the Syracusan station, as the
leaders were mustering their men immediately before embarkation. They
had been apprized of the grappling-irons now about to be employed by
the Athenians, and had guarded against them in part by stretching
hides along their bows, so that the “iron hand” might slip off
without acquiring any hold. The preparatory movements even within the
Athenian station being perfectly visible, Gylippus sent the fleet out
with the usual prefatory harangue. He complimented them on the great
achievements which they had already performed in breaking down the
naval power of Athens, so long held irresistible.<a id="FNanchor_482"
href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> He reminded them that
the sally of their enemies was only a last effort of despair, seeking
nothing but escape, undertaken without confidence in themselves,
and under the necessity of throwing aside all their own tactics in
order to copy feebly those of the Syracusans.<a id="FNanchor_483"
href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> He called upon
them to recollect the destructive purposes which the invaders had
brought with them against Syracuse, to inflict with resentful hand
the finishing stroke upon this half-ruined armament, and to taste
the delight of satiating a legitimate revenge.<a id="FNanchor_484"
href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<p>The Syracusan fleet—seventy-six triremes strong, as in the
last battle—was the first to put off from shore; Pythen with the
Corinthians in the centre, Sikanus and Agatharchus on the wings. A
certain proportion of them were placed near the mouth of the harbor,
in order to guard the barrier; while the rest were distributed around
the harbor in order to attack the Athenians from different sides as
soon as they should approach. Moreover, the surface of the harbor
swarmed with the light craft of the Syracusans, in many of which
embarked youthful volun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[p.
324]</span>teers, sons of the best families in the city;<a
id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>
boats of no mean service during the battle, saving or destroying
the seamen cast overboard from disabled ships, as well as annoying
the fighting Athenian triremes. The day was one sacred to Hêraklês
at Syracuse; and the prophets announced that the god would insure
victory to the Syracusans, provided they stood on the defensive, and
did not begin the attack.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486"
class="fnanchor">[486]</a> Moreover, the entire shore round the
harbor, except the Athenian station and its immediate neighborhood,
was crowded with Syracusan soldiers and spectators; while the walls
of Ortygia, immediately overhanging the water, were lined with the
feebler population of the city, the old men, women, and children.
From the Athenian station presently came forth one hundred and ten
triremes, under Demosthenês, Menander, and Euthydêmus, with the
customary pæan, its tone probably partaking of the general sadness
of the camp. They steered across direct to the mouth of the harbor,
beholding on all sides the armed enemies ranged along the shore, as
well as the unarmed multitudes who were imprecating the vengeance
of the gods upon their heads; while for them there was no sympathy,
except among the fellow-sufferers within their own lines. Inside of
this narrow basin, rather more than five English miles in circuit,
one hundred and ninety-four ships of war, each manned with more
than two hundred men, were about to join battle, in the presence
of countless masses around, all with palpitating hearts, and near
enough both to see and hear; the most picturesque battle—if we could
abstract our minds from its terrible interest<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_325">[p. 325]</span> —probably in history, without smoke or
other impediments to vision, and in the clear atmosphere of Sicily, a
serious and magnified realization of those naumachiæ which the Roman
emperors used to exhibit with gladiators on the Italian lakes, for
the recreation of the people.</p>

<p>The Athenian fleet made directly for that portion of the barrier
where a narrow opening—perhaps closed by a movable chain—had been
left for merchant-vessels. Their first impetuous attack broke through
the Syracusan squadron defending it, and they were already attempting
to sever its connecting bonds, when the enemy from all sides crowded
in upon them and forced them to desist. Presently the battle became
general, and the combatants were distributed in various parts of the
harbor. On both sides a fierce and desperate courage was displayed,
even greater than had been shown on any of the former occasions.
At the first onset, the skill and tactics of the steersmen shone
conspicuous, well seconded by zeal on the part of the rowers and by
their ready obedience to the voice of the keleustês. As the vessels
neared, the bowmen, slingers, and throwers on the deck, hurled clouds
of missiles against the enemy; next, was heard the loud crash of the
two impinging metallic fronts, resounding all along the shore.<a
id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>
When the vessels were thus once in contact, they were rarely allowed
to separate: a strenuous hand-fight then commenced by the hoplites
in each, trying respectively to board and master their enemy’s deck.
It was not always, however, that each trireme had its own single
and special enemy: sometimes one ship had<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_326">[p. 326]</span> two or three enemies to contend with
at once, sometimes she fell aboard of one unsought, and became
entangled. After a certain time, the fight still obstinately
continuing, all sort of battle order became lost; the skill of the
steersman was of little avail, and the voice of the keleustês was
drowned amidst the universal din and mingled cries from victors as
well as vanquished. On both sides emulous exhortations were poured
forth, together with reproach and sarcasm addressed to any ship which
appeared flinching from the contest; though factitious stimulus of
this sort was indeed but little needed.</p>

<p>Such was the heroic courage on both sides, that for a long time
victory was altogether doubtful, and the whole harbor was a scene
of partial encounters, wherein sometimes Syracusans, sometimes
Athenians, prevailed. According as success thus fluctuated, so
followed the cheers or wailings of the spectators ashore. At one and
the same time, every variety of human emotion might be witnessed;
according as attention was turned towards a victorious or a defeated
ship. It was among the spectators in the Athenian station above all,
whose entire life and liberty were staked in the combat, that this
emotion might be seen exaggerated into agony, and overpassing the
excitement even of the combatants themselves.<a id="FNanchor_488"
href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> Those among them who
looked towards a portion of the harbor where their friends seemed
winning, were full of joy and thanksgiving to the gods: such of their
neighbors who contemplated an Athenian ship in difficulty, gave vent
to their feelings in shrieks and lamentation; while a third group,
with their eyes fixed on some portion of the combat still disputed,
were plunged in all the agitations of doubt, manifested even in
the tremulous swing of their bodies, as hope or fear alternately
predominated. During all the time that the combat remained undecided,
the Athenians ashore were distracted by all these manifold varieties
of intense sympathy. But at length the moment came, after a
long-protracted struggle, when victory began to declare in favor of
the Syracusans, who, perceiving that their enemies were slackening,
redoubled their shouts as well as their efforts, and pushed them all
back towards the land. All the Athenian triremes, abandoning farther
resistance, were thrust ashore like shipwrecked<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_327">[p. 327]</span> vessels in or near their own station; a
few being even captured before they could arrive there. The diverse
manifestations of sympathy among the Athenians in the station itself
were now exchanged for one unanimous shriek of agony and despair.
The boldest of them rushed to rescue the ships and their crews from
pursuit, others to man their walls in case of attack from land: many
were even paralyzed at the sight, and absorbed with the thoughts
of their own irretrievable ruin. Their souls were doubtless still
farther subdued by the wild and enthusiastic joy which burst forth
in maddening shouts from the hostile crowds around the harbor, in
response to their own victorious comrades on shipboard.</p>

<p>Such was the close of this awful, heart-stirring, and decisive
combat. The modern historian strives in vain to convey the impression
of it which appears in the condensed and burning phrases of
Thucydidês. We find in his description of battles generally, and
of this battle beyond all others, a depth and abundance of human
emotion which has now passed out of military proceedings. The Greeks
who fight, like the Greeks who look on, are not soldiers withdrawn
from the community, and specialized as well as hardened by long
professional training, but citizens with all the passions, instincts,
sympathies, joys, and sorrows of domestic as well as political
life. Moreover, the non-military population in ancient times had an
interest of the most intense kind in the result of the struggle;
which made the difference to them, if not of life and death, at
least of the extremity of happiness and misery. Hence the strong
light and shade, the Homeric exhibition of undisguised impulse, the
tragic detail of personal motive and suffering, which pervades this
and other military descriptions of Thucydidês. When we read the few
but most vehement words which he employs to depict the Athenian camp
under this fearful trial, we must recollect that these were not only
men whose all was at stake, but that they were moreover citizens full
of impressibility, sensitive and demonstrative Greeks; and, indeed,
the most sensitive and demonstrative of all Greeks. To repress all
manifestations of strong emotion was not considered in ancient times
essential to the dignity of the human character.</p>

<p>Amidst all the deep pathos, however, which the great
historian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[p. 328]</span> has
imparted to the final battle at Syracuse, he has not explained the
causes upon which its ultimate issue turned. Considering that the
Athenians were superior to their enemies in number, as one hundred
and ten to seventy-six triremes, that they fought with courage
not less heroic, and that the action was on their own element, we
might have anticipated for them, if not a victory, at least a drawn
battle, with equal loss on both sides. But we may observe, 1. The
number of one hundred and ten triremes was formed by including
some hardly seaworthy.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489"
class="fnanchor">[489]</a> 2. The crews were composed partly of men
not used to sea-service; and the Akarnanian darters, especially, were
for this reason unhandy with their missiles.<a id="FNanchor_490"
href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> 3. Though the
water had been hitherto the element favorable to Athens, yet
her superiority in this respect was declining, and her enemies
approaching nearer to her, even in the open sea. But the narrow
dimensions of the harbor would have nullified her superiority at
all times, and placed her even at great disadvantage,—without the
means of twisting and turning her triremes so as to strike only at
a vulnerable point of the enemy,—compared with the thick, heavy,
straightforward butting of the Syracusans; like a nimble pugilist
of light weight contending, in a very confined ring, against
superior weight and muscle.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491"
class="fnanchor">[491]</a> For the mere land-fight on shipboard,
Athenians had not only no advantage, but had on the contrary the
odds against them. 4. The Syracusans enjoyed great advantage from
having nearly the whole harbor lined round with their soldiers and
friends; not simply from the force of encouraging sympathy, no<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[p. 329]</span> mean auxiliary, but
because any of their triremes, if compelled to fall back before an
Athenian, found protection on the shore, and could return to the
fight at leisure; while an Athenian in the same predicament had no
escape. 5. The numerous light craft of the Syracusans doubtless
rendered great service in this battle, as they had done in the
preceding, though Thucydidês does not again mention them. 6. Lastly,
both in the Athenian and Syracusan characters, the pressure of
necessity was less potent as a stimulus to action, than hopeful
confidence and elation, with the idea of a flood-tide yet mounting.
In the character of some other races, the Jews for instance, the
comparative force of these motives appears to be the other way.</p>

<p>About sixty Athenian triremes, little more than half of the
fleet which came forth, were saved as the wreck from this terrible
conflict. The Syracusans on their part had suffered severely; only
fifty triremes remaining out of seventy-six. The triumph with
which, nevertheless, on returning to the city, they erected their
trophy, and the exultation which reigned among the vast crowds
encircling the harbor, was beyond all measure or precedent. Its
clamorous manifestations were doubtless but too well heard in the
neighboring camp of the Athenians, and increased, if anything could
increase, the soul-subduing extremity of distress which paralyzed the
vanquished. So utterly did the pressure of suffering, anticipated as
well as actual, benumb their minds and extinguish their most sacred
associations, that no man among them, not even the ultra-religious
Nikias, thought of picking up the floating bodies or asking for a
truce to bury the dead. This obligation, usually so serious and
imperative upon the survivors after a battle, now passed unheeded
amidst the sorrow, terror, and despair, of the living man for
himself.</p>

<p>Such despair, however, was not shared by the generals, to their
honor be it spoken. On the afternoon of this terrible defeat,
Demosthenês proposed to Nikias that at daybreak the ensuing morning
they should man all the remaining ships—even now more in number than
the Syracusan—and make a fresh attempt to break out of the harbor.
To this Nikias agreed, and both proceeded to try their influence in
getting the resolution executed. But so irreparably was the spirit
of the seamen broken, that nothing could prevail upon them to go
again on shipboard: they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[p.
330]</span> would hear of nothing but attempting to escape by land.<a
id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
Preparations were therefore made for commencing their march in
the darkness of that very night. The roads were still open, and,
had they so marched, a portion of them, at least, might even
yet have been saved.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493"
class="fnanchor">[493]</a> But there occurred one more mistake, one
farther postponement, which cut off the last hopes of this gallant
and fated remnant.</p>

<p>The Syracusan Hermokratês, fully anticipating that the Athenians
would decamp that very night, was eager to prevent their retreat,
because of the mischief which they might do if established in
any other part of Sicily. He pressed Gylippus and the military
authorities to send out forthwith, and block up the principal
roads, passes, and fords, by which the fugitives would get off.
Though sensible of the wisdom of his advice, the generals thought
it wholly unexecutable. Such was the universal and unbounded joy
which now pervaded the city, in consequence of the recent victory,
still farther magnified by the circumstance that the day was sacred
to Hêraklês,—so wild the jollity, the feasting, the intoxication,
the congratulations, amidst men rewarding themselves after their
recent effort and triumph, and amidst the necessary care for the
wounded,—that an order to arm and march out would have been as little
listened to as the order to go on shipboard was by the desponding
Athenians. Perceiving that he could get nothing done until the next
morning, Hermokratês resorted to a stratagem in order to delay
the departure of the Athenians for that night. At the moment when
darkness was beginning, he sent down some confidential friends on
horseback to the Athenian wall. These men, riding up near enough
to make themselves heard, and calling for the sentries, addressed
them as messengers from the private correspondents of Nikias in
Syracuse, who had sent to warn him, they affirmed, not to decamp
during the night, inasmuch as the Syracusans had already beset and
occupied the roads; but to begin his march quietly the next morning
after adequate preparation.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494"
class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>This fraud—the same as the Athenians had themselves practised
two years before,<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495"
class="fnanchor">[495]</a> in order to tempt the Syracusans to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[p. 331]</span> march out against
Katana—was perfectly successful: the sincerity of the information was
believed, and the advice adopted. Had Demosthenês been in command
alone, we may doubt whether he would have been so easily duped; for
granting the accuracy of the fact asserted, it was not the less
obvious that the difficulties, instead of being diminished, would
be increased tenfold on the following day. We have seen, however,
on more than one previous occasion, how fatally Nikias was misled
by his treacherous advices from the philo-Athenians at Syracuse.
An excuse for inaction was always congenial to his character; and
the present recommendation, moreover, fell in but too happily with
the temper of the army, now benumbed with depression and terror,
like those unfortunate soldiers, in the Retreat of the Ten Thousand
Greeks, who were yielding to the lethargy of extreme cold on the
snows of Armenia, and whom Xenophon vainly tried to arouse.<a
id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>
Having remained over that night, the generals determined also
to stay the next day,—in order that the army might carry away
with them as much of their baggage as possible,—sending forward
a messenger to the Sikels in the interior to request that they
would meet the army, and bring with them a supply of provisions.<a
id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
Gylippus and Hermokratês had thus ample time, on the following day,
to send out forces and occupy all the positions convenient for
obstructing the Athenian march. They at the same time towed into
Syracuse as prizes all the Athenian triremes which had been driven
ashore in the recent battle, and which now lay like worthless hulks,
unguarded and unheeded,<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498"
class="fnanchor">[498]</a> seemingly even those within the station
itself.</p>

<p>It was on the next day but one after the maritime defeat that
Nikias and Demosthenês put their army in motion to attempt retreat.
The camp had long been a scene of sickness and death from the
prevalence of marsh fever; but since the recent battle the number
of wounded men, and the unburied bodies of the slain, had rendered
it yet more pitiable. Forty thousand miserable men—so prodigious
was the total, including all ranks and functions—now set forth to
quit it, on a march of which few could hope to see the end; like
the pouring forth of the population of a<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_332">[p. 332]</span> large city starved out by blockade.
Many had little or no provisions to carry, so low had the stock
become reduced; but of those who had, every man carried his own, even
the horsemen and hoplites, now for the first time either already left
without slaves, by desertion, or knowing that no slave could now be
trusted. But neither such melancholy equality of suffering, nor the
number of sufferers, counted for much in the way of alleviation. A
downcast stupor and sense of abasement possessed every man; the more
intolerable, when they recollected the exit of the armament from
Peiræus two years before, with prayers, and solemn pæans, and all
the splendid dreams of conquest, set against the humiliation of the
closing scene now before them, without a single trireme left out of
two prodigious fleets.</p>

<p>But it was not until the army had actually begun its march that
the full measure of wretchedness was felt and manifested. It was then
that the necessity first became proclaimed, which no one probably
spoke out beforehand, of leaving behind not merely the unburied
bodies, but also the sick and the wounded. The scenes of woe which
marked this hour passed endurance or description. The departing
soldier sorrowed and shuddered with the sentiment of an unperformed
duty, as he turned from the unburied bodies of the slain; but far
more terrible was the trial, when he had to tear himself from the
living sufferers, who implored their comrades, with wailings of agony
and distraction, not to abandon them. Appealing to all the claims
of pious friendship, they clung round their knees, and even crawled
along the line of march until their strength failed. The silent
dejection of the previous day was now exchanged for universal tears
and groans, and clamorous outbursts of sorrow, amidst which the army
could not without the utmost difficulty be disengaged and put in
motion.</p>

<p>After such heart-rending scenes, it might seem that their cup of
bitterness was exhausted; but worse was yet in store, and the terrors
of the future dictated a struggle against all the miseries of past
and present. The generals did their best to keep up some sense of
order as well as courage; and Nikias, particularly, in this closing
hour of his career, displayed a degree of energy and heroism which he
had never before seemed to possess. Though himself among the greatest
personal sufferers of all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[p.
333]</span> from his incurable complaint, he was seen everywhere in
the ranks marshalling the troops, heartening up their dejection,
and addressing them with a voice louder, more strenuous, and more
commanding than was his wont.</p>

<p>“Keep up your hope still, Athenians (he said), even as we are
now: others have been saved out of circumstances worse than ours.
Be not too much humiliated, either with your defeats or with your
present unmerited hardships. I too, having no advantage over any of
you in strength,—nay, you see the condition to which I have been
brought by my disease,—and accustomed even to superior splendor and
good fortune in private as well as public life, I too am plunged in
the same peril with the humblest soldier among you. Nevertheless, my
conduct has been constantly pious towards the gods as well as just
and blameless towards men; in recompense for which, my hope for the
future is yet sanguine, at the same time that our actual misfortunes
do not appall me in proportion to their intrinsic magnitude.<a
id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>
Perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[p. 334]</span> indeed,
they may from this time forward abate; for our enemies have had
their full swing of good fortune, and if, at the moment of our
starting, we were under the jealous wrath of any of the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[p. 335]</span> gods, we have already
undergone chastisement amply sufficient. Other people before us have
invaded foreign lands, and after having done what was competent
to human power, have suffered what was within the limit of human
endurance. We too may reasonably hope henceforward to have the
offended god dealing with us more mildly, for we are now objects
fitter for his compassion than for his jealousy.<a id="FNanchor_500"
href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> Look, moreover, at
your own ranks, hoplites so numerous and so excellent: let that guard
you against excessive despair, and recollect that, wherever you may
sit down, you are yourselves at once a city; nor is there any other
city in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[p. 336]</span> Sicily
that can either repulse your attack or expel you if you choose to
stay. Be careful yourselves to keep your march firm and orderly,
every man of you with this conviction, that whatever spot he may be
forced to fight in, that spot is his country and his fortress, and
must be kept by victorious effort. As our provisions are very scanty,
we shall hasten on night and day alike; and so soon as you reach
any friendly village of the Sikels, who still remain constant to us
from hatred to Syracuse, then consider yourselves in security. We
have sent forward to apprize them, and intreat them to meet us with
supplies. Once more, soldiers, recollect that to act like brave men
is now a matter of necessity to you, and that if you falter, there
is no refuge for you anywhere. Whereas if you now get clear of your
enemies, such of you as are not Athenians will again enjoy the sight
of home, while such of you as <i>are</i> Athenians will live to renovate
the great power of our city, fallen though it now be. <i>It is men that
make a city; not walls, nor ships without men.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_501"
href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>The efforts of both commanders were in full harmony with these
strenuous words. The army was distributed into two divisions; the
hoplites marching in a hollow oblong, with the baggage and unarmed in
the interior. The front division was commanded by Nikias, the rear by
Demosthenês. Directing their course towards the Sikel territory, in
the interior of the island, they first marched along the left bank
of the Anapus until they came to the ford of that river, which they
found guarded by a Syracusan detachment. They forced the passage,
however, without much resistance, and accomplished on that day a
march of about five miles, under the delay arising from the harassing
of the enemy’s cavalry and light troops. Encamping for that night
on an eminence, they recommenced their march with the earliest
dawn, and halted, after about two miles and a half, in a deserted
village on a plain. They were in hopes of finding some provisions
in the houses, and were even under the necessity of carrying along
with them some water from this spot; there being none to be found
farther on. As their intended line of march had now become evident,
the Syracusans profited by this halt to get<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_337">[p. 337]</span> on before them, and to occupy in force
a position on the road, called the Akræan cliff. Here the road,
ascending a high hill, formed a sort of ravine bordered on each
side by steep cliffs. The Syracusans erected a wall or barricade
across the whole breadth of the road, and occupied the high ground
on each side. But even to reach this pass was beyond the competence
of the Athenians; so impracticable was it to get over the ground in
the face of overwhelming attacks from the enemy’s cavalry and light
troops. They were compelled, after a short march, to retreat to their
camp of the night before.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502"
class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>Every hour added to the distress of their position; for their
food was all but exhausted, nor could any man straggle from the main
body without encountering certain destruction from the cavalry.
Accordingly, on the next morning, they tried one more desperate
effort to get over the hilly ground into the interior. Starting
very early, they arrived at the foot of the hill called the Akræan
cliff, where they found the barricades placed across the road, with
deep files of Syracusan hoplites behind them, and crowds of light
troops lining the cliffs on each border. They made the most strenuous
and obstinate efforts to force this inexpugnable position, but all
their struggles were vain, while they suffered miserably from the
missiles of the troops above. Amidst all the discouragement of this
repulse, they were yet farther disheartened by storms of thunder and
lightning, which occurred during the time, and which they construed
as portents significant of their impending ruin.<a id="FNanchor_503"
href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>This fact strikingly illustrates both the change which the last
two years had wrought in the contending parties, and the degree to
which such religious interpretations of phenomena depended for their
efficacy on predisposing temper, gloomy or cheerful. In the first
battle between Nikias and the Syracusans, near the Great Harbor,
some months before the siege was begun, a similar thunder-storm had
taken place: on that occasion the Athenian soldiers had continued
the battle unmoved, treating it as a natural event belonging to the
season, and such indifference on their part<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_338">[p. 338]</span> had still farther imposed upon the
alarmed Syracusans.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504"
class="fnanchor">[504]</a> Now, both the self-confidence and the
religious impression had changed sides.</p>

<p>Exhausted by their fruitless efforts, the Athenians fell back
a short space to repose, when Gylippus tried to surround them by
sending a detachment to block up the narrow road in their rear. This,
however, they prevented, effecting their retreat into the open plain,
where they passed the night, and on the ensuing day attempted once
more the hopeless march over the Akræan cliff. But they were not
allowed even to advance so far as the pass and the barricade. They
were so assailed and harassed by the cavalry and darters, in flank
and rear, that, in spite of heroic effort and endurance, they could
not accomplish a progress of so much as one single mile. Extenuated
by fatigue, half-starved, and with numbers of wounded men, they
were compelled to spend a third miserable night in the same fatal
plain.</p>

<p>As soon as the Syracusans had retired for the night to their
camp, Nikias and Demosthenês took counsel. They saw plainly that the
route which they had originally projected, over the Akræan cliff
into the Sikel regions of the interior and from thence to Katana,
had become impracticable, and that their unhappy troops would be
still less in condition to force it on the morrow than they had been
on the day preceding. Accordingly, they resolved to make off during
the night, leaving numerous fires burning to mislead the enemy;
but completely to alter the direction, and to turn down towards
the southern coast on which lay Kamarina and Gela. Their guides
informed them that if they could cross the river Kakyparis, which
fell into the sea south of Syracuse, on the southeastern coast of
Sicily, or a river still farther on, called the Erineus,—they might
march up the right bank of either into the regions of the interior.
Accordingly, they broke up in the night, amidst confusion and alarm;
in spite of which, the front division of the army under Nikias got
into full march, and made considerable advance. By daybreak this
division reached the southeastern coast of the island not far south
of Syracuse, and fell into the track of the Helôrine road, which
they pursued until they arrived at the Kakyparis. Even here,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[p. 339]</span> however, they found a
Syracusan detachment beforehand with them, raising a redoubt, and
blocking up the ford; nor could Nikias pass it without forcing his
way through them. He marched straightforward to the Erineus, which
he crossed on the same day, and encamped his troops on some high
ground on the other side.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505"
class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p>Except at the ford of the Kakyparis, his march had been all
day unobstructed by the enemy; and he thought it wiser to push
hid troops as fast as possible, in order to arrive at some place
both of safety and subsistence, without concerning himself about
the rear division under Demosthenês. That division, the larger
half of the army, started both later and in great disorder.
Unaccountable panics and darkness made them part company or miss
their way, so that Demosthenês, with all his efforts to keep them
together, made little progress, and fell much behind Nikias. He was
overtaken by the Syracusans during the forenoon, seemingly before
he reached the Kakyparis,<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506"
class="fnanchor">[506]</a> and at a moment when<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_340">[p. 340]</span> the foremost division was nearly six
miles ahead, between the Kakyparis and the Erineus.</p>

<p>When the Syracusans discovered at dawn that their enemy had
made off in the night, their first impulse was to accuse Gylippus
of treachery in having permitted the escape. Such ungrateful
surmises, however, were soon dissipated, and the cavalry set forth
in rapid pursuit, until they overtook the rear division, which they
immediately began to attack and impede. The advance of Demosthenês
had been tardy before, and his division disorganized: but he was
now compelled to turn and defend himself against an indefatigable
enemy, who presently got before him and thus stopped him altogether.
Their numerous light troops and cavalry assailed him on all sides
and without intermission; employing nothing but missiles, however,
and taking care to avoid any close encounter. While this unfortunate
division were exerting their best efforts both to defend themselves,
and if possible to get forward, they found themselves inclosed
in a walled olive-ground, through the middle of which the road
passed; a farm bearing the name, and probably once the property,
of Polyzêlus, brother of the despot Gelon.<a id="FNanchor_507"
href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> Entangled and huddled
up in this inclosure, from whence exit at the farther end in the face
of an enemy was found impossible, they were now overwhelmed with
hostile missiles from the walls on all sides.<a id="FNanchor_508"
href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> Though unable to get
at the en<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[p. 341]</span>emy,
and deprived even of the resources of an active despair, they
endured incessant harassing for the greater part of the day,
without refreshment or repose, and with the number of their wounded
continually increasing; until at length the remaining spirit of the
unhappy sufferers was thoroughly broken. Perceiving their condition,
Gylippus sent to them a herald with a proclamation; inviting all
the islanders among them to come forth from the rest, and promising
them freedom if they did so. The inhabitants of some cities, yet
not many,—a fact much to their honor,—availed themselves of this
offer and surrendered. Presently, however, a larger negotiation
was opened, which ended by the entire division capitulating upon
terms, and giving up their arms. Gylippus and the Syracusans
engaged that the lives of all should be spared; that is, that none
should be put to death either by violence, or by intolerable bonds,
or by starvation. Having all been disarmed, they were forthwith
conveyed away as prisoners to Syracuse, six thousand in number.
It is a remarkable proof of the easy and opulent circumstances
of many among these gallant sufferers, when we are told that the
money which they had about them, even at this last moment of
pressure, was sufficient to fill the concavities of four shields.<a
id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>
Disdaining either to surrender or to make any stipulation for
himself personally, Demosthenês was on the point of killing himself
with his own sword the moment that the capitulation was concluded;
but his intention was prevented, and he was carried off a disarmed
prisoner by the Syracusans.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510"
class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[p. 342]</span></p>

<p>On the next day, Gylippus and the victorious Syracusans overtook
Nikias on the right bank of the Erineus, apprized him of the
capitulation of Demosthenês, and summoned him to capitulate also. He
demanded leave to send a horseman for the purpose of verifying the
statement; and on the return of the horseman, he made a proposition
to Gylippus, that his army should be permitted to return home, on
condition of Athens reimbursing to Syracuse the whole expense of
the war, and furnishing hostages until payment should be made;
one citizen against each talent of silver. These conditions were
rejected; but Nikias could not yet bring himself to submit to
the same terms for his division as Demosthenês. Accordingly, the
Syracusans recommenced their attacks, which the Athenians, in spite
of hunger and fatigue, sustained as they best could until night. It
was the intention of Nikias again to take advantage of the night for
the purpose of getting away. But on this occasion the Syracusans
were on the watch, and as soon as they heard movement in the camp,
they raised the pæan, or war-shout; thus showing that they were
on the lookout, and inducing the Athenians again to lay down the
arms which they had taken up for departure. A detachment of three
hundred Athenians, nevertheless, still persisting in marching off,
apart from the rest, forced their way through the posts of the
Syracusans. These men got safely away, and nothing but the want of
guides prevented them from escaping altogether.<a id="FNanchor_511"
href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></p>

<p>During all this painful retreat, the personal resolution displayed
by Nikias was exemplary; his sick and feeble frame was made to bear
up, and even to hearten up stronger men, against the extremity of
hardship, exhausting the last fragment of hope or even possibility.
It was now the sixth day of the retreat,—six days<a id="FNanchor_512"
href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> of constant
privation, suffering, and endurance of attack,—yet Nikias early in
the morning attempted a fresh march, in order to get to the river
Asinarus, which falls into the same sea, south of the Erineus, but
is a more considerable stream, flowing deeply imbedded between lofty
banks. This was a last effort of despair, with little hope of final
escape, even if they did reach it. Yet the march was accomplished, in
spite of renewed and inces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[p.
343]</span>sant attacks all the way, from the Syracusan cavalry; who
even got to the river before the Athenians, occupying the ford, and
lining the high banks near it. Here the resolution of the unhappy
fugitives at length gave way; when they reached the river, their
strength, their patience, their spirit, and their hopes for the
future, were all extinct. Tormented with raging thirst, and compelled
by the attacks of the cavalry to march in one compact mass, they
rushed into the ford all at once, treading down and tumbling over
each other in the universal avidity for drink. Many thus perished
from being pushed down upon the points of the spears, or lost their
footing among the scattered articles of baggage, and were thus
borne down under water.<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513"
class="fnanchor">[513]</a> Meanwhile, the Syracusans from above
poured upon the huddled mass showers of missiles, while the
Peloponnesian hoplites even descended into the river, came to close
quarters with them, and slew considerable numbers. So violent,
nevertheless, was the thirst of the Athenians, that all other
suffering was endured in order to taste relief by drinking. And
even when dead and wounded were heaped in the river,—when the
water was tainted and turbid with blood, as well as thick with
the mud trodden up,—still, the new-comers pushed their way in and
swallowed it with voracity.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514"
class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p>

<p>Wretched, helpless, and demoralized as the army now was,
Nikias could think no farther of resistance. He accordingly
surrendered himself to Gylippus, to be dealt with at the discretion
of that general and of the Lacedæmonians,<a id="FNanchor_515"
href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> earnestly imploring
that the slaughter of the defenceless soldiers might be arrested.
Accordingly, Gylippus gave orders that no more should be killed, but
that the rest should be secured as captives. Many were slain before
this order was understood; but of those who remained, almost all were
made captive, very few escaping. Nay, even the detachment of three
hundred, who had broken out in the night, having seemingly not known
whither to go, were captured,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[p.
344]</span> and brought in by troops sent forth for the purpose.<a
id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> The
triumph of the Syracusans was in every way complete, they hung the
trees on the banks of the Asinarus with Athenian panoplies as trophy,
and carried back their prisoners in joyous procession to the city.</p>

<p>The number of prisoners thus made, is not positively specified
by Thucydidês, as in the case of the division of Demosthenês, which
had capitulated and laid down their arms in a mass within the
walls of the olive-ground. Of the captives from the division of
Nikias, the larger proportion were seized by private individuals,
and fraudulently secreted for their own profit; the number
obtained for the state being comparatively small, seemingly not
more than one thousand.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517"
class="fnanchor">[517]</a> The various Sicilian towns became soon
full of these prisoners, sold as slaves for private account.</p>

<p>Not less than forty thousand persons in the aggregate had started
from the Athenian camp to commence the retreat, six days before. Of
these probably many, either wounded or otherwise incompetent even
when the march began, soon found themselves unable to keep up, and
were left behind to perish. Each of the six days was a day of hard
fighting and annoyance from an indefatigable crowd of light troops,
with little, and at last seemingly nothing, to eat. The number was
thus successively thinned, by wounds, privations, and straggling,
so that the six thousand taken with Demosthenês, and perhaps three
thousand or four thousand captured with Nikias, formed the melancholy
remnant. Of the stragglers during the march, however, we are glad
to learn that many contrived to escape the Syracusan cavalry and
get to Katana, where also those who afterwards ran away from their
slavery under private masters, found a refuge.<a id="FNanchor_518"
href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> These fugitive<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[p. 345]</span> Athenians served as
auxiliaries to repel the attacks of the Syracusans upon Katana.<a
id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>It was in this manner, chiefly, that Athens came to receive again
within her bosom a few of those ill-fated sons whom she had drafted
forth in two such splendid divisions to Sicily. For of those who
were carried as prisoners to Syracuse, fewer yet could ever have
got home. They were placed for safe custody, along with the other
prisoners, in the stone-quarries of Syracuse,—of which there were
several, partly on the southern descent of the outer city towards
the Nekropolis, or from the higher level to the lower level of
Achradina,—partly in the suburb afterwards called Neapolis, under
the southern cliff of Epipolæ. Into these quarries—deep hollows
of confined space, with precipitous sides, and open at the top to
the sky—the miserable prisoners were plunged, lying huddled one
upon another, without the smallest protection or convenience. For
subsistence, they received each day a ration of one pint of wheaten
bread,—half the daily ration of a slave,—with no more than half
a pint of water, so that they were not preserved from the pangs
either of hunger or of thirst. Moreover, the heat of the midday sun,
alternating with the chill of the autumn nights, was alike afflicting
and destructive; while the wants of life having all to be performed
where they were, without relief, the filth and stench presently
became insupportable. Sick and wounded even at the moment of arrival,
many of them speedily died; and happiest was he who died the first,
leaving an unconscious corpse, which the Syracusans would not take
the trouble to remove, to distress and infect the survivors. Under
this condition and treatment they remained for seventy days; probably
serving as a spectacle for the triumphant Syracusan population,
with their wives and children, to come and look down upon, and to
congratulate themselves on their own narrow escape from sufferings
similar in kind at least, if not in degree. After that time the
novelty of the spectacle had worn off, while the place must have
become a den of abomination and a nuisance intolerable even to the
citizens themselves. Accordingly, they now removed all the surviving
prisoners, except the native Athenians<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_346">[p. 346]</span> and the few Italian or Sicilian
Greeks among them. All those so removed were sold for slaves;<a
id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>
while the dead bodies were probably at the same time taken away,
and the prison rendered somewhat less loathsome. What became of the
remaining prisoners, we are not told; it may be presumed that those
who could survive so great an extremity of suffering might after a
certain time be allowed to get back to Athens on ransom. Perhaps
some of them may have obtained their release; as was the case,
we are told, with several of those who had been sold to private
masters, by the elegance of their accomplishments and the dignity of
their demeanor. The dramas of Euripidês were so peculiarly popular
throughout all Sicily, that those Athenian prisoners who knew by
heart considerable portions of them, won the affections of their
masters. Some even of the stragglers from the army are affirmed to
have procured for themselves, by the same attraction, shelter and
hospitality during their flight. Euripidês, we are informed, lived to
receive the thanks of several among these unhappy sufferers, after
their return to Athens.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521"
class="fnanchor">[521]</a> I cannot refrain from mentioning this
story, though I fear its trustworthiness as matter of fact is much
inferior to its pathos and interest.</p>

<p>Upon the treatment of Nikias and Demosthenês, not merely the
Syracusans, but also the allies present, were consulted, and much
difference of opinion was found. To keep them in confinement
simply, without putting them to death, was apparently the opinion
advocated by Hermokratês.<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522"
class="fnanchor">[522]</a> But Gylippus, then in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[p. 347]</span> full ascendency and an
object of deep gratitude for his invaluable services, solicited as a
reward to himself to be allowed to conduct them back as prisoners to
Sparta. To achieve this would have earned for him signal honor in the
eyes of his countrymen; for while Demosthenês, from his success at
Pylos, was their hated enemy, Nikias had always shown himself their
friend as far as an Athenian could do so. It was to him that they
owed the release of their prisoners taken at Sphakteria; and he had
calculated upon this obligation when he surrendered himself prisoner
to Gylippus, and not to the Syracusans.</p>

<p>In spite of all his influence, however, Gylippus could not carry
this point. First, the Corinthians both strenuously opposed him
themselves, and prevailed on the other allies to do the same. They
were afraid that the wealth of Nikias would always procure for him
the means of escaping from imprisonment, so as to do them farther
injury, and they insisted on his being put to death. Next, those
Syracusans, who had been in secret correspondence with Nikias during
the siege, were yet more anxious to get him put out of the way,
being apprehensive that, if tortured by their political opponents,
he might disclose their names and intrigues. Such various influences
prevailed, and Nikias as well as Demosthenês was ordered to be put to
death by a decree of the public assembly, much to the discontent of
Gylippus. Hermokratês vainly opposed the resolution, but perceiving
that it was certain to be carried, he sent to them a private
intimation before the discussion closed; and procured for them,
through one of the sentinels, the means of dying by their own hands.
Their bodies were publicly exposed before the city gates to the view
of the Syracusan citizens;<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523"
class="fnanchor">[523]</a> while the day on which the final capture
of Nikias and his army was accomplished, came to be celebrated
as an annual festival, under the title of the Asinaria, on the
twenty-sixth day of the Dorian month Karneius.<a id="FNanchor_524"
href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[p. 348]</span></p>

<p>Such was the close of the expedition, or rather of the two
expeditions, undertaken by Athens against Syracuse. Never in Grecian
history had a force so large, so costly, so efficient, and so full
of promise and confidence, been turned out; never in Grecian history
had ruin so complete and sweeping, or victory so glorious and
unexpected, been witnessed.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525"
class="fnanchor">[525]</a> Its consequences were felt from one end
of the Grecian world to the other, as will appear in the coming
chapters.</p>

<p>The esteem and admiration felt at Athens towards Nikias had
been throughout lofty and unshaken; after his death it was
exchanged for disgrace. His name was omitted, while that of his
colleague Demosthenês was engraved, on the funereal pillar erected
to commemorate the fallen warriors. This difference Pausanias
explains by saying that Nikias was conceived to have disgraced
himself as a military man by his voluntary surrender, which
Demosthenês had disdained.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526"
class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_349">[p. 349]</span></p> <p>The opinion of Thucydidês
deserves special notice, in the face of this judgment of his
countrymen. While he says not a word about Demosthenês, beyond the
fact of his execution, he adds in reference to Nikias a few words
of marked sympathy and commendation. “Such, or nearly such, (he
says,) were the reasons why Nikias was put to death; though <i>he</i>
assuredly, among all Greeks of my time, least deserved to come to so
extreme a pitch of ill-fortune, considering his exact performance
of established duties to the divinity.”<a id="FNanchor_527"
href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>If we were judging Nikias merely as a private man, and setting
his personal conduct in one scale against his personal suffer<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[p. 350]</span>ing on the other, the
remark of Thucydidês would be natural and intelligible. But the
general of a great expedition, upon whose conduct the lives of
thousands of brave men as well as the most momentous interests of his
country, depend, cannot be tried by any such standard. His private
merit becomes a secondary point in the case, as compared with the
discharge of his responsible public duties, by which he must stand or
fall.</p>

<p>Tried by this more appropriate standard, what are we to say of
Nikias? We are compelled to say, that if his personal suffering
could possibly be regarded in the light of an atonement, or set in
an equation against the mischief brought by himself both on his army
and his country, it would not be greater than his deserts. I shall
not here repeat the separate points in his conduct which justify this
view, and which have been set forth as they have occurred, in the
preceding pages. Admitting fully both the good intentions of Nikias,
and his personal bravery, rising even into heroism during the last
few days in Sicily, it is not the less incontestable, that, first,
the failure of the enterprise, next, the destruction of the armament,
is to be traced distinctly to his lamentable misjudgment. Sometimes
petty trifling, sometimes apathy and inaction, sometimes presumptuous
neglect, sometimes obstinate blindness even to urgent and obvious
necessities, one or other of these his sad mental defects, will be
found operative at every step, whereby this fated armament sinks down
from exuberant efficiency into the last depth of aggregate ruin and
individual misery. His improvidence and incapacity stand proclaimed,
not merely in the narrative of the historian, but even in his own
letter to the Athenians, and in his own speeches both before the
expedition and during its closing misfortunes, when contrasted with
the reality of his proceedings. The man whose flagrant incompetency
brought such wholesale ruin upon two fine armaments intrusted to
his command, upon the Athenian maritime empire, and ultimately upon
Athens herself, must appear on the tablets of history under the
severest condemnation, even though his personal virtues had been
loftier than those of Nikias.</p>

<p>And yet our great historian, after devoting two immortal books
to this expedition, after setting forth emphatically both the glory
of its dawn and the wretchedness of its close, with a dramatic
genius parallel to the Œdipus Tyrannus of Sophoklês, when he<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[p. 351]</span> comes to recount the
melancholy end of the two commanders, has no words to spare for
Demosthenês,—far the abler officer of the two, who perished by no
fault of his own,—but reserves his flowers to strew on the grave
of Nikias, the author of the whole calamity—“What a pity! Such a
respectable and religious man!”</p>

<p>Thucydidês is here the more instructive, because he exactly
represents the sentiment of the general Athenian public towards
Nikias during his lifetime. They could not bear to condemn, to
mistrust, to dismiss, or to do without, so respectable and religious
a citizen. The private qualities of Nikias were not only held to
entitle him to the most indulgent construction of all his public
shortcomings, but also insured to him credit for political and
military competence altogether disproportionate to his deserts.
When we find Thucydidês, after narrating so much improvidence and
mismanagement on the grand scale, still keeping attention fixed on
the private morality and decorum of Nikias, as if it constituted the
main feature of his character, we can understand how the Athenian
people originally came both to over-estimate this unfortunate leader,
and continued over-estimating him with tenacious fidelity even after
glaring proof of his incapacity. Never in the political history
of Athens did the people make so fatal a mistake in placing their
confidence.</p>

<p>In reviewing the causes of popular misjudgment, historians are
apt to enlarge prominently, if not exclusively, on demagogues and
demagogic influences. Mankind being usually considered in the
light of governable material, or as instruments for exalting,
arming, and decorating their rulers, whatever renders them more
difficult to handle in this capacity, ranks first in the category
of vices. Nor can it be denied that this was a real and serious
cause: clever criminative speakers often passed themselves off for
something above their real worth; though useful and indispensable
as a protection against worse, they sometimes deluded the people
into measures impolitic or unjust. But, even if we grant, to the
cause of misjudgment here indicated, a greater practical efficiency
than history will fairly sanction, still, it is only one among
others more mischievous. Never did any man at Athens, by mere force
of demagogic qualities, acquire a measure of esteem at once so
exaggerated and so durable, combined with so much power of injuring
his fellow-citizens, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[p.
352]</span> anti-demagogic Nikias. The man who, over and above his
shabby manœuvre about the expedition against Sphakteria, and his
improvident sacrifice of Athenian interests in the alliance with
Sparta, ended by inflicting on his country that cruel wound which
destroyed so many of her citizens as well as her maritime empire, was
not a leather-seller of impudent and criminative eloquence, but a
man of ancient family and hereditary wealth, munificent and affable,
having credit not merely for the largesses which he bestowed, but
also for all the insolences, which as a rich man he might have
committed, but did not commit,—free from all pecuniary corruption,—a
brave man, and above all, an ultra-religious man, believed therefore
to stand high in the favor of the gods, and to be fortunate. Such
was the esteem which the Athenians felt for this union of good
qualities purely personal and negative with eminent station, that
they presumed the higher aptitudes of command,<a id="FNanchor_528"
href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> and presumed them,
unhappily, after proof that they did not exist,—after proof that what
they had supposed to be caution was only apathy and mental weakness.
No demagogic arts or eloquence would ever have created in the people
so deep-seated an illusion as the imposing respectability of Nikias.
Now it was against the overweening ascendency of such decorous and
pious incompetence, when aided by wealth and family advantages, that
the demagogic accusatory eloquence ought to have served as a natural
bar and corrective. Performing the functions of a constitutional
opposition, it afforded the only chance of that tutelary exposure
whereby blunders and shortcomings might be arrested in time. How
insufficient was the check which it provided,—even at Athens, where
every one denounces it as having prevailed in devouring excess,—the
history of Nikias is an ever-living testimony.</p>

  FROM THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ATHENIAN ARMAMENT IN SICILY, DOWN TO
  THE OLIGARCHICAL CONSPIRACY OF THE FOUR HUNDRED AT ATHENS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span>
the preceding chapter we followed to its melancholy close the united
armament of Nikias and Demosthenês, first in the harbor and lastly
in the neighborhood of Syracuse, towards the end of September, 413
<small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>The first impression which we derive from the perusal of that
narrative is, sympathy for the parties directly concerned, chiefly
for the number of gallant Athenians who thus miserably perished,
partly also for the Syracusan victors, themselves a few months before
on the verge of apparent ruin. But the distant and collateral effects
of the catastrophe throughout Greece, were yet more momentous than
those within the island in which it occurred.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that even at the moment when Demosthenês
with his powerful armament left Peiræus to go to Sicily, the
hostilities of the Peloponnesian confederacy against Athens herself
had been already recommenced. Not only was the Spartan king Agis
ravaging Attica, but the far more important step of fortifying
Dekeleia, for the abode of a permanent garrison, was in course of
completion. That fortress, having been begun about the middle of
March, was probably by the month of June in a situation to shelter
its garrison, which consisted of contingents periodically furnished,
and relieving each other alternately, from all the different states
of the confederacy, under the permanent command of king Agis himself.</p>

<p>And now began that incessant marauding of domiciliated
enemies—destined to last for nine years until the final capture
of Athens—partially contemplated even at the beginning of the
Peloponnesian war, and recently enforced, with full comprehension
of its disastrous effects, by the virulent antipathy of the
exile Alkibiadês.<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529"
class="fnanchor">[529]</a> The earlier invasions of Attica had
been all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[p. 354]</span>
temporary, continuing for five or six weeks at the farthest, and
leaving the country in repose for the remainder of the year. But the
Athenians now underwent from henceforward the fatal experience of a
hostile garrison within fifteen miles of their city; an experience
peculiarly painful this summer, as well from its novelty as from
the extraordinary vigor which Agis displayed in his operations.
His excursions were so widely extended, that no part of Attica
was secure or could be rendered productive. Not only were all the
sheep and cattle destroyed, but the slaves too, especially the most
valuable slaves, or artisans, began to desert to Dekeleia in great
numbers; more than twenty thousand of them soon disappeared in this
way. So terrible a loss of income, both to proprietors of land and
to employers in the city, was farther aggravated by the increased
cost and difficulty of import from Eubœa. Provisions and cattle
from that island had previously come over land from Oropus, but
as that road was completely stopped by the garrison of Dekeleia,
they were now of necessity sent round Cape Sunium by sea; a transit
more circuitous and expensive, besides being open to attack from
the enemy’s privateers.<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530"
class="fnanchor">[530]</a> In the midst of such heavy privations,
the demands on citizens and metics for military duty were multiplied
beyond measure. The presence of the enemy at Dekeleia forced them
to keep watch day and night throughout their long extent of wall,
comprising both Athens and Peiræus: in the daytime the hoplites
of the city relieved each other on guard, but at night, nearly
all of them were either on the battlements or at the various
military stations in the city. Instead of a city, in fact, Athens
was reduced to the condition of something like a military post.<a
id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>
Moreover, the rich citizens of the state, who<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_355">[p. 355]</span> served as horsemen, shared in the
general hardship; being called on for daily duty in order to restrain
at least, since they could not entirely prevent, the excursions
of the garrison of Dekeleia, their efficiency was, however, soon
impaired by the laming of their horses on the hard and stony soil.<a
id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>Besides the personal efforts of the citizens, such exigencies
pressed heavily on the financial resources of the state. Already the
immense expense incurred in fitting out the two large armaments for
Sicily, had exhausted all the accumulations laid by in the treasury
during the interval since the Peace of Nikias; so that the attacks
from Dekeleia, not only imposing heavy additional cost, but at the
same time cutting up the means of paying, brought the finances of
Athens into positive embarrassment. With the view of increasing her
revenues, she altered the principle on which her subject-allies had
hitherto been assessed: instead of a fixed sum of annual tribute, she
now required from them payment of a duty of five per cent. on all
imports and exports by sea.<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533"
class="fnanchor">[533]</a> How this new principle of assessment
worked, we have unfortunately no information. To collect the duty and
take precautions against evasion, an Athenian custom-house officer
must have been required in each allied city. Yet it is difficult to
understand how Athens could have enforced a system at once novel,
extensive, vexatious, and more burdensome to the payers, when we come
to see how much her hold over those payers, as well as her naval
force, became enfeebled, before the close even of the actual year.<a
id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[p. 356]</span></p>

<p>Her impoverished finances also compelled her to dismiss a body of
Thracian mercenaries, whose aid would have been very useful against
the enemy at Dekeleia. These Thracian peltasts, thirteen hundred in
number, had been hired at a drachma per day each man, to go with
Demosthenês to Syracuse, but had not reached Athens in time. As soon
as they came thither, the Athenians placed them under the command
of Diitrephês, to conduct them back to their native country, with
instructions to do damage to the Bœotians, as opportunity might
occur, in his way through the Euripus. Accordingly, Diitrephês,
putting them on shipboard, sailed round Sunium and northward along
the eastern coast of Attica. After a short disembarkation near
Tanagra, he passed on to Chalkis in Eubœa in the narrowest part
of the strait, from whence he crossed in the night to the Bœotian
coast opposite, and marched up some distance from the sea to the
neighborhood of the Bœotian town Mykalêssus. He arrived here unseen,
lay in wait near a temple of Hermês about two miles distant, and fell
upon the town unexpectedly at break of day. To the Mykalessians,
dwelling in the centre of Bœotia, not far from Thebes, and at a
considerable distance from the sea, such an assault was not less
unexpected than formidable. Their fortifications were feeble, in
some parts low, in other parts even tumbling down; nor had they even
taken the precaution to close their gates at night: so that the
barbarians under Diitrephês, entering the town without the smallest
difficulty, began at once the work of pillage and destruction. The
scene which followed was something alike novel and revolting to
Grecian eyes. Not only were all the houses and even the temples
plundered, but the Thracians farther manifested that raging thirst
for blood which seemed inherent in their race. They slew every
living thing that came in their way; men, women, children, horses,
cattle, etc. They burst into a school, wherein many boys had just
been assembled, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[p.
357]</span>massacred them all. This scene of bloodshed, committed by
barbarians who had not been seen in Greece since the days of Xerxes,
was recounted with horror and sympathy throughout all Grecian
communities, though Mykalêssus was in itself a town of second-rate
or third-rate magnitude.<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535"
class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

<p>The succor brought from Thebes, by Mykalessian fugitives, arrived
unhappily only in time to avenge, but not to save, the inhabitants.
The Thracians were already retiring with the booty which they could
carry away, when the bœotarch Skirphondas overtook them, both
with cavalry and hoplites, after having put to death some greedy
plunderers who tarried too long in the town. He compelled them to
relinquish most of their booty, and pursued them to the sea-shore;
not without a brave resistance from these peltasts, who had a
peculiar way of fighting which disconcerted the Thebans. But when
they arrived at the sea-shore, the Athenian ships did not think
it safe to approach very close, so that not less than two hundred
and fifty Thracians were slain before they could get aboard;<a
id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> and
the Athenian commander, Diitrephês was so severely wounded that he
died shortly afterwards. The rest pursued their voyage homeward.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the important station of Naupaktus and the mouth of
the Corinthian gulf again became the theatre of naval encounter.
It will be recollected that this was the scene of the memorable
victories gained by the Athenian admiral Phormion in the second year
of the Peloponnesian war,<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537"
class="fnanchor">[537]</a> wherein the nautical superiority of
Athens over her enemies, as to ships, crews, and admiral, had been
so transcendently manifested. In that respect matters had now
considerably changed. While the navy of Athens had fallen off since
the days of Phormion, that of her enemy had improved: Ariston,
and other skilful Corinthian steersmen,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_358">[p. 358]</span> not attempting to copy Athenian
tactics, had studied the best mode of coping with them, and
had modified the build of their own triremes accordingly,<a
id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> at
Corinth as well as at Syracuse. Seventeen years before, Phormion with
eighteen Athenian triremes would have thought himself a full match
for twenty-five Corinthian; but the Athenian admiral of this year,
Konon, also a perfectly brave man, now judged so differently, that
he constrained Demosthenês and Eurymedon to reinforce his eighteen
triremes with ten others,—out of the best of their fleet, at a
time when they had certainly none to spare,—on the ground that the
Corinthian fleet opposite, of twenty-five sail, was about to assume
the offensive against him.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539"
class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>Soon afterwards Diphilus came to supersede Konon, with some
fresh ships from Athens, which made the total number of triremes
thirty-three. The Corinthian fleet, reinforced so as to be nearly of
the same number, took up a station on the coast of Achaia opposite
Naupaktus, at a spot called Erineus, in the territory of Rhypes.
They ranged themselves across the mouth of a little indentation of
the coast, or bay, in the shape of a crescent, with two projecting
promontories as horns: each of these promontories was occupied by a
friendly land-force, thus supporting the line of triremes at both
flanks. This was a position which did not permit the Athenians to
sail through the line, or manœuvre round it and in the rear of it.
Accordingly, when the fleet of Diphilus came across from Naupaktus,
it remained for some time close in front of the Corinthians, neither
party venturing to attack; for the straightforward collision was
destructive to the Athenian ships with their sharp, but light and
feeble beaks, while it was favorable to the solid bows and thick
epôtids, or ear-projections, of the Corinthian trireme. After
considerable delay, the Corinthians at length began the attack on
their side, yet not advancing far enough out to sea to admit of the
manœuvring and evolutions of the Athenians. The battle lasted some
time, terminating with no decisive advantage to either party. Three
Corinthian triremes were completely disabled, though the crews of
all escaped by swimming to their friends ashore: on the Athenian
side, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[p. 359]</span> one
trireme became absolutely water-logged, but seven were so much
damaged, by straightforward collision with the stronger bows of
the enemy, that they became almost useless after they got back
to Naupaktus. The Athenians had so far the advantage, that they
maintained their station, while the Corinthians did not venture to
renew the fight: moreover, both the wind and the current set towards
the northern shore, so that the floating fragments and dead bodies
came into possession of the Athenians. Each party thought itself
entitled to erect a trophy, but the real feeling of victory lay on
the side of Corinth, and that of defeat on the side of Athens. The
reputed maritime superiority of the latter was felt by both parties
to have sustained a diminution; and such assuredly would have been
the impression of Phormion, had he been alive to witness it.<a
id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>This battle appears to have taken place, so far as we can make
out, a short time before the arrival of Demosthenês at Syracuse,
about the close of the month of May. We cannot doubt that the
Athenians most anxiously expected news from that officer, with some
account of victories obtained in Sicily, to console them for having
sent him away at a moment when his services were so cruelly wanted
at home. Perhaps they may even have indulged hopes of the near
capture of Syracuse, as a means of restoring their crippled finances.
Their disappointment would be all the more bitter when they came to
receive, towards the end of June or beginning of July, despatches
announcing the capital defeat of Demosthenês in his attempt upon
Epipolæ, and the consequent extinction of all hope that Syracuse
could ever be taken. After these despatches, we may perhaps doubt
whether any others subsequently reached Athens. The generals would
not write home during the month of indecision immediately succeeding,
when Demosthenês was pressing for retreat, and Nikias resisting it.
They might possibly, however, write immediately on taking their
resolution to retreat, at the time when they sent to Katana to forbid
farther supplies of provisions, but this was the last practicable
opportunity; for closely afterwards followed their naval defeat,
and the blocking up of the mouth of the Great Harbor. The mere
absence of intelligence would satisfy the Athenians that their<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[p. 360]</span> affairs in Sicily were
proceeding badly; but the closing series of calamities, down to the
final catastrophe, would only come to their knowledge indirectly;
partly through the triumphant despatches transmitted from Syracuse to
Sparta, Corinth, and Thebes, partly through individual soldiers of
their own armament who escaped.</p>

<p>According to the tale of Plutarch, the news was first made known
at Athens through a stranger, who, arriving at Peiræus, went into a
barber’s shop and began to converse about it, as upon a theme which
must of course be uppermost in every one’s mind.</p>

<p>The astonished barber, hearing for the first time such fearful
tidings, ran up to Athens to communicate it to the archons as well
as to the public in the market-place. The public assembly being
forthwith convoked, he was brought before it, and called upon to
produce his authority, which he was unable to do, as the stranger
had disappeared. He was consequently treated as a fabricator of
uncertified rumors for the disturbance of the public tranquillity,
and even put to the torture.<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541"
class="fnanchor">[541]</a> How much of this improbable tale may be
true, we cannot determine; but we may easily believe that neutrals,
passing from Corinth or Megara to Peiræus, were the earliest
communicants of the misfortunes of Nikias and Demosthenês in Sicily
during the months of July and August. Presently came individual
soldiers of the armament, who had got away from the defeat and found
a passage home; so that the bad news was but too fully confirmed.
But the Athenians were long before they could bring themselves to
believe, even upon the testimony of these fugitives, how entire
had been the destruction of their two splendid armaments, without
even a feeble remnant left to console them.<a id="FNanchor_542"
href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

<p>As soon as the full extent of their loss was at length forced
upon their convictions, the city presented a scene of the deepest
affliction, dismay, and terror. Over and above the extent of private
mourning, from the loss of friends and relatives, which overspread
nearly the whole city, there prevailed utter despair as to the
public safety. Not merely was the empire of Athens apparently lost,
but Athens herself seemed utterly defenceless. Her treasury was
empty, her docks nearly destitute of triremes, the flower of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[p. 361]</span> her hoplites as well
as of her seamen had perished in Sicily without leaving their like
behind, and her maritime reputation was irretrievably damaged; while
her enemies, on the contrary, animated by feelings of exuberant
confidence and triumph, were farther strengthened by the accession
of their new Sicilian allies. In these melancholy months—October,
November, 413 <small>B.C.</small>—the Athenians expected
nothing less than a vigorous attack, both by land and sea, from the
Peloponnesian and Sicilian forces united, with the aid of their
own revolted allies, an attack which they knew themselves to be in
no condition to repel.<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543"
class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>Amidst so gloomy a prospect, without one ray of hope to cheer them
on any side, it was but poor satisfaction to vent their displeasure
on the chief speakers who had recommended their recent disastrous
expedition, or on those prophets and reporters of oracles who had
promised them the divine blessing upon it.<a id="FNanchor_544"
href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_362">[p. 362]</span> After this first burst both of grief
and anger, however, they began gradually to look their actual
situation in the face; and the more energetic speakers would
doubtless administer the salutary lesson of reminding them how much
had been achieved by their forefathers, sixty-seven years before,
when the approach of Xerxes threatened them with dangers not less
overwhelming. Under the peril of the moment, the energy of despair
revived in their bosoms; they resolved to get together, as speedily
as they could, both ships and money,—to keep watch over their
allies, especially Eubœa,—and to defend themselves to the last. A
Board of ten elderly men, under the title of Probûli, was named
to review the expenditure, to suggest all practicable economies,
and propose for the future such measures as occasion might seem to
require. The propositions of these probûli were for the most part
adopted, with a degree of unanimity and promptitude rarely seen
in an Athenian assembly, springing out of that pressure and alarm
of the moment which silenced all criticism.<a id="FNanchor_545"
href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> Among other
economies, the Athenians abridged the costly splendor of their choric
and liturgic ceremonies at home, and brought back the recent garrison
which they had established on the Laconian coast; they at the same
time collected timber, commenced the construction of new ships, and
fortified Cape Sunium, in order to protect their numerous transport
ships in the passage from Eubœa to Peiræus.<a id="FNanchor_546"
href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[p. 363]</span></p>

<p>While Athens was thus struggling to make head against her
misfortunes, all the rest of Greece was full of excitement and
aggressive scheming against her. So vast an event as the destruction
of this great armament had never happened since the expedition of
Xerxes against Greece. It not only roused the most distant cities
of the Grecian world, but also the Persian satraps and the court of
Susa. It stimulated the enemies of Athens to redoubled activity;
it emboldened her subject-allies to revolt; it pushed the neutral
states, who all feared what she would have done if successful against
Syracuse, now to declare war against her, and put the finishing
stroke to her power as well as to her ambition. All of them, enemies,
subjects, and neutrals, alike believed that the doom of Athens was
sealed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[p. 364]</span> that
the coming spring would see her captured. Earlier than the ensuing
spring, the Lacedæmonians did not feel disposed to act; but they sent
round their instructions to the allies for operations both by land
and sea to be then commenced; all these allies being prepared to do
their best, in hopes that this effort would be the last required from
them, and the most richly rewarded. A fleet of one hundred triremes
was directed to be prepared against the spring; fifty of these being
imposed in equal proportion on the Lacedæmonians themselves and the
Bœotians; fifteen on Corinth; fifteen on the Phocians and Lokrians;
ten on the Arcadians, with Pellênê and Sikyon; ten on Megara,
Trœzen, Epidaurus, and Hermionê. It seems to have been considered
that these ships might be built and launched during the interval
between September and March.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547"
class="fnanchor">[547]</a> The same large hopes, which had worked
upon men’s minds at the beginning of the war, were now again
rife in the bosoms of the Peloponnesians;<a id="FNanchor_548"
href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> the rather as that
powerful force from Sicily, which they had then been disappointed
in obtaining, might now be anticipated with tolerable assurance
as really forthcoming.<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549"
class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p>From the smaller allies, contributions in money were exacted
for the intended fleet by Agis, who moved about during this autumn
with a portion of the garrison of Dekeleia. In the course of his
circuit, he visited the town of Herakleia, near the Maliac gulf, and
levied large contributions on the neighboring Œtæans, in reprisal
for the plunder which they had taken from that town, as well as from
the Phthiot Achæans and other subjects of the Thessalians, though
the latter vainly entered their protest against his proceedings.<a
id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

<p>It was during the march of Agis through Bœotia that the
inhabitants of Eubœa—probably of Chalkis and Eretria—applied to
him, entreating his aid to enable them to revolt from Athens; which
he readily promised, sending for Alkamenês at the head of three
hundred Neodamode hoplites from Sparta, to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_365">[p. 365]</span> be despatched across to the island
as harmost. Having a force permanently at his disposal, with full
liberty of military action, the Spartan king at Dekeleia was
more influential even than the authorities at home, so that the
disaffected allies of Athens addressed themselves in preference to
him. It was not long before envoys from Lesbos visited him for this
purpose. So powerfully was their claim enforced by the Bœotians
(their kinsmen of the Æolic race), who engaged to furnish ten
triremes for their aid, provided Agis would send ten others, that he
was induced to postpone his promise to the Eubœans, and to direct
Alkamenês as harmost to Lesbos instead of Eubœa,<a id="FNanchor_551"
href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> without at all
consulting the authorities at Sparta.</p>

<p>The threatened revolt of Lesbos and Eubœa, especially the latter,
was a vital blow to the empire of Athens. But this was not the
worst. At the same time that these two islands were negotiating with
Agis, envoys from Chios, the first and most powerful of all Athenian
allies, had gone to Sparta for the same purpose. The government of
Chios,—an oligarchy, but distinguished for its prudent management
and caution in avoiding risks,—considering Athens to be now on the
verge of ruin, even in the estimation of the Athenians themselves,
thought itself safe, together with the opposite city of Erythræ,
in taking measures for achieving independence.<a id="FNanchor_552"
href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>Besides these three great allies, whose example in revolting
was sure to be followed by others, Athens was now on the point of
being assailed by other enemies yet more unexpected, the two Persian
satraps of the Asiatic seaboard, Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus. No
sooner was the Athenian catastrophe in Sicily known at the court
of Susa, than the Great King claimed from these two satraps the
tribute due from the Asiatic Greeks on the coast; for which they
had always stood enrolled in the tribute records, though it had
never been actually levied since the complete establishment of the
Athenian empire. The only way to realize this tribute, for which the
satraps were thus made debtors, was to detach the towns from Athens,
and break up her empire;<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553"
class="fnanchor">[553]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[p.
366]</span> for which purpose Tissaphernes sent an envoy to Sparta,
in conjunction with those of the Chians and Erythræans. He invited
the Lacedæmonians to conclude an alliance with the Great King, for
joint operations against the Athenian empire in Asia; promising to
furnish pay and maintenance for any forces which they might send, at
the rate of one drachma per day for each man of the ship’s crews.<a
id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> He
farther hoped by means of this aid to reduce Amorgês the revolted
son of the late satrap Pissuthnês, who was established in the
strong maritime town of Iasus, with a Grecian mercenary force and a
considerable treasure, and was in alliance with Athens. The Great
King had sent down a peremptory mandate, that Amorgês should be
either brought prisoner to Susa or slain.</p>

<p>At the same moment, though without any concert, there arrived
at Sparta Kalligeitus and Timagoras, two Grecian exiles in the
service of Pharnabazus, bringing propositions of a similar
character from that satrap, whose government<a id="FNanchor_555"
href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> comprehended the
coast lands north of Æolis, from the Euxine and Propontis, to the
northeast corner of the Elæatic gulf. Eager to have the assistance
of a Lacedæmonian fleet in order to detach the Hellespontine Greeks
from Athens, and realize the tribute required by the court of
Susa, Pharnabazus was at the same time desirous of forestalling
Tissaphernes as the medium of alliance between Sparta and the Great
King. The two missions having thus arrived simultaneously at Sparta,
a strong competition arose between them, one striving to attract
the projected expedition to Chios, the other to the Hellespont:<a
id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>
for which latter purpose, Kalligeitus<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_367">[p. 367]</span> had brought twenty-five talents, which
he tendered as a first payment in part.</p>

<p>From all quarters, new enemies were thus springing up against
Athens in the hour of her distress, and the Lacedæmonians had
only to choose which they would prefer; a choice in which they
were much guided by the exile Alkibiadês. It so happened that
his family friend Endius was at this moment one of the board of
ephors; while his personal enemy king Agis, with whose wife Timæa
he carried on an intrigue,<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557"
class="fnanchor">[557]</a> was absent in command at Dekeleia. Knowing
well the great power and importance of Chios, Alkibiadês strenuously
exhorted the Spartan authorities to devote their first attention to
that island. A periœkus named Phrynis, being sent thither to examine
whether the resources alleged by the envoys were really forthcoming,
brought back a satisfactory report, that the Chian fleet was not less
than sixty triremes strong: upon which the Lacedæmonians concluded
an alliance with Chios and Erythræ, engaging to send a fleet of
forty sail to their aid. Ten of these triremes, now ready in the
Lacedæmonian ports—probably at Gythium—were directed immediately
to sail to Chios, under the admiral Melanchridas. It seems to have
been now midwinter; but Alkibiadês, and still more the Chian envoys,
insisted on the necessity of prompt action, for fear that the
Athenians should detect the intrigue. However, an earthquake just
then intervening, was construed by the Spartans as an index of divine
displeasure, so that they would not persist in sending either the
same commander or the same ships. Chalkideus was named to supersede
Melanchridas, while five new ships were directed to be equipped, so
as to be ready to sail in the early spring along with the larger
fleet from Corinth.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558"
class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<p>As soon as spring arrived, three Spartan commissioners were sent
to Corinth—in compliance with the pressing instances of the Chian
envoys—to transport across the isthmus from the Corinthian to the
Saronic gulf, the thirty-nine triremes now in the Corinthian port
of Lechæum. It was at first proposed to send off all, at one and
the same time, to Chios, even those which Agis had been equipping
for the assistance of Lesbos; although Kalli<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_368">[p. 368]</span>geitus declined any concern with Chios,
and refused to contribute for this purpose any of the money which he
had brought. A general synod of deputies from the allies was held at
Corinth, wherein it was determined, with the concurrence of Agis,
to despatch the fleet first to Chios, under Chalkideus; next, to
Lesbos, under Alkamenês; lastly, to the Hellespont, under Klearchus.
But it was judged expedient to divide the fleet, and bring across
twenty-one triremes out of the thirty-nine, so as to distract the
attention of Athens, and divide her means of resistance. So low was
the estimate formed of these means, that the Lacedæmonians did not
scruple to despatch their expedition openly from the Saronic gulf,
where the Athenians would have full knowledge both of its numbers
and of its movements.<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559"
class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>Hardly had the twenty-one triremes, however, been brought across
to Kenchreæ, when a fresh delay arose to obstruct their departure.
The Isthmian festival, celebrated every alternate year, and kept
especially holy by the Corinthians, was just approaching; nor would
they consent to begin any military operations until it was concluded,
though Agis tried to elude their scruples by offering to adopt the
intended expedition as his own. It was during the delay which thus
ensued that the Athenians were first led to conceive suspicions about
Chios, whither they despatched Aristokratês, one of the generals of
the year. The Chian authorities strenuously denied all projects of
revolt, and being required by Aristokratês to furnish some evidence
of their good faith, sent back along with him seven triremes to the
aid of Athens. It was much against their own will that they were
compelled thus to act; but they knew that the Chian people were in
general averse to the idea of revolting from Athens, nor did they
feel confidence enough to proclaim their secret designs without some
manifestation of support from Peloponnesus, which had been so much
delayed that they knew not when it would arrive. The Athenians, in
their present state of weakness, perhaps thought it prudent to accept
insufficient assurances, for fear of driving this powerful island to
open revolt. But during the Isthmian festival, to which they were
invited along with other Greeks, they discovered farther evidences
of the plot which was going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[p.
369]</span> on, and resolved to keep strict watch on the motions
of the fleet now assembled at Kenchreæ, suspecting that this
squadron was intended to second the revolting party in Chios.<a
id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after the Isthmian festival, the squadron actually started
from Kenchreæ to Chios, under Alkamenês; but an equal number of
Athenian ships watched them as they sailed along the shore, and
tried to tempt them farther out to sea, with a view to fight them.
Alkamenês, however, desirous of avoiding a battle, thought it best
to return back; upon which the Athenians also returned to Peiræus,
mistrusting the fidelity of the seven Chian triremes which formed
part of their fleet. Reappearing presently with a larger squadron of
thirty-seven triremes, they pursued Alkamenês, who had again begun
his voyage along the shore southward, and attacked him near the
uninhabited harbor called Peiræum, on the frontiers of Corinth and
Epidaurus. They here gained a victory, captured one of his ships,
and damaged or disabled most of the remainder. Alkamenês himself
was slain, and the ships were run ashore, where on the morrow the
Pelo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[p. 370]</span>ponnesian
land-force arrived in sufficient numbers to defend them. So
inconvenient, however, was their station on this desert spot, that
they at first determined to burn the vessels and depart. Nor was it
without difficulty that they were induced, partly by the instances
of king Agis, to guard the ships until an opportunity could be
found for eluding the blockading Athenian fleet; a part of which
still kept watch off the shore, while the rest were stationed at
a neighboring islet.<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561"
class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<p>The Spartan ephors had directed Alkamenês, at the moment of his
departure from Kenchræa, to despatch a messenger to Sparta, in order
that the five triremes under Chalkideus and Alkibiadês might leave
Laconia at the same moment. And these latter appear to have been
actually under way, when a second messenger brought the news of the
defeat and death of Alkamenês at Peiræum. Besides the discouragement
arising from such a check at the outset of their plans against Ionia,
the ephors thought it impossible to begin operations with so small a
squadron as five triremes, so that the departure of Chalkideus was
for the present countermanded. This resolution, perfectly natural to
adopt, was only reversed at the strenuous instance of the Athenian
exile Alkibiadês, who urged them to permit Chalkideus and himself to
start forthwith. Small as the squadron was, yet as it would reach
Chios before the defeat at Peiræum became public, it might be passed
off as the precursor of the main fleet; while he (Alkibiadês) pledged
himself to procure the revolt of Chios and the other Ionic cities,
through his personal connection with the leading men, who would
repose confidence in his assurances of the helplessness of Athens, as
well as of the thorough determination of Sparta to stand by them. To
these arguments, Alkibiadês added an appeal to the personal vanity
of Endius; whom he instigated to assume for himself the glory of
liberating Ionia as well as of first commencing the Persian alliance,
instead of leaving this enterprise to king Agis.<a id="FNanchor_562"
href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>By these arguments—assisted doubtless by his personal influence,
since his advice respecting Gylippus and respecting Dekeleia
had turned out so successful—Alkibiadês obtained the consent of
the Spartan ephors, and sailed along with Chalkideus in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[p. 371]</span> the five triremes
to Chios. Nothing less than his energy and ascendency could have
extorted from men both dull and backward, a determination apparently
so rash, yet, in spite of such appearance, admirably conceived,
and of the highest importance. Had the Chians waited for the fleet
now blocked up at Peiræum, their revolt would at least have been
long delayed, and perhaps might not have occurred at all: the
accomplishment of that revolt by the little squadron of Alkibiadês
was the proximate cause of all the Spartan successes in Ionia, and
was ultimately the means even of disengaging the fleet at Peiræum, by
distracting the attention of Athens. So well did this unprincipled
exile, while playing the game of Sparta, know where to inflict the
dangerous wounds upon his country!</p>

<p>There was, indeed, little danger in crossing the Ægean to Ionia,
with ever so small a squadron; for Athens in her present destitute
condition had no fleet there, and although Strombichidês was detached
with eight triremes from the blockading fleet off Peiræum, to pursue
Chalkideus and Alkibiadês as soon as their departure was known, he
was far behind them, and soon returned without success. To keep their
voyage secret, they detained the boats and vessels which they met,
and did not liberate them, until they reached Korykus in Asia Minor,
the mountainous land southward of Erythræ. They were here visited by
their leading partisans from Chios, who urged them to sail thither
at once before their arrival could be proclaimed. Accordingly,
they reached the town of Chios—on the eastern coast of the island,
immediately opposite to Erythræ on the continent—to the astonishment
and dismay of every one, except the oligarchical plotters who had
invited them. By the contrivance of these latter, the council was
found just assembling, so that Alkibiadês was admitted without
delay, and invited to state his case. Suppressing all mention of
the defeat at Peiræum, he represented his squadron as the foremost
of a large Lacedæmonian fleet actually at sea and approaching,
and affirmed Athens to be now helpless by sea as well as by land,
incapable of maintaining any farther hold upon her allies. Under
these impressions, and while the population were yet under their
first impulse of surprise and alarm, the oligarchical council took
the resolution of revolting. The example was followed by Erythræ, and
soon after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[p. 372]</span>wards
by Klazomenæ, determined by three triremes from Chios. The
Klazomenians had hitherto dwelt upon an islet close to the continent;
on which latter, however, a portion of their town, called Polichnê,
was situated, which they now resolved, in anticipation of attack
from Athens, to fortify as their main residence. Both the Chians and
Erythræans also actively employed themselves in fortifying their
towns and preparing for war.<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563"
class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p>In reviewing this account of the revolt of Chios, we find occasion
to repeat remarks already suggested by previous revolts of other
allies of Athens,—Lesbos, Akanthus, Torônê, Mendê, Amphipolis,
etc. Contrary to what is commonly intimated by historians, we may
observe first, that Athens did not systematically interfere to
impose her own democratical government upon her allies; next, that
the empire of Athens, though upheld mainly by an established belief
in her superior force, was nevertheless by no means odious, nor
the proposition of revolting from her acceptable to the general
population of her allies. She had at this moment no force in Ionia;
and the oligarchical government of Chios, wishing to revolt, was only
prevented from openly declaring its intention by the reluctance of
its own population, a reluctance which it overcame partly by surprise
arising from the sudden arrival of Alkibiadês and Chalkideus,
partly by the fallacious assurance of a still greater Peloponnesian
force approaching.<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564"
class="fnanchor">[564]</a> Nor would the Chian oligarchy themselves
have determined to revolt, had they not been persuaded that such was
now the safer course, inasmuch as Athens was now ruined, and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[p. 373]</span> her power to protect,
not less than her power to oppress, at an end.<a id="FNanchor_565"
href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> The envoys of
Tissaphernês had accompanied those of Chios to Sparta, so that the
Chian government saw plainly that the misfortunes of Athens had only
the effect of reviving the aggressions and pretensions of their
former foreign master, against whom Athens had protected them for the
last fifty years. We may well doubt, therefore, whether this prudent
government looked upon the change as on the whole advantageous.
But they had no motive to stand by Athens in her misfortunes, and
good policy seemed now to advise a timely union with Sparta as the
preponderant force. The sentiment entertained towards Athens by her
allies, as I have before observed, was more negative than positive.
It was favorable rather than otherwise, in the minds of the general
population, to whom she caused little actual hardship or oppression;
but averse, to a certain extent, in the minds of their leading men,
since she wounded their dignity, and offended that love of town
autonomy which was instinctive in the Grecian political mind.</p>

<p>The revolt of Chios, speedily proclaimed, filled every man at
Athens with dismay. It was the most fearful symptom, as well as the
heaviest aggravation, of their fallen condition; especially as there
was every reason to apprehend that the example of this first and
greatest among the allies would be soon followed by the rest. The
Athenians had no fleet or force even to attempt its reconquest: but
they now felt the full importance of that reserve of one thousand
talents, which Perikles had set aside in the first year of the
war against the special emergency of a hostile fleet approaching
Peiræus. The penalty of death had been decreed against any one
who should propose to devote this fund to any other purpose; and,
in spite of severe financial pressure, it had remained untouched
for twenty years. Now, however, though the special contingency
foreseen had not yet arisen, matters were come to such an extremity,
that the only chance of saving the remaining empire was by the
appropriation of this money. An unanimous vote was accordingly
passed to abrogate the penal enactment, or standing order, against
proposing any other mode<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[p.
374]</span> of appropriation; after which the resolution was taken
to devote this money to present necessities.<a id="FNanchor_566"
href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p>By means of this new fund, they were enabled to find pay and
equipment for all the triremes ready or nearly ready in their harbor,
and thus to spare a portion from their blockading fleet off Peiræum;
out of which Strombichidês with his squadron of eight triremes was
despatched immediately to Ionia; followed, after a short interval,
by Thrasyklês, with twelve others. At the same time, the seven
Chian triremes which also formed part of this fleet, were cleared
of their crews; among whom such as were slaves were liberated,
while the freemen were put in custody. Besides fitting out an equal
number of fresh ships to keep up the numbers of the blockading
fleet, the Athenians worked with the utmost ardor to get ready
thirty additional triremes. The extreme exigency of the situation,
since Chios had revolted, was felt by every one: yet with all their
efforts, the force which they were enabled to send was at first
lamentably inadequate. Strombichidês, arriving at Samos, and finding
Chios, Erythræ, and Klazomenæ already in revolt, reinforced his
little squadron with one Samian trireme, and sailed to Teos,—on the
continent, at the southern coast of that isthmus, of which Klazomenæ
is on the northern,—in hopes of preserving that place. But he had not
been long there when Chalkideus arrived from Chios with twenty-three
triremes, all or mostly Chian; while the forces of Erythræ and
Klazomenæ approached by land. Strombichidês was obliged to make
a hasty flight back to Samos, vainly pursued by the Chian fleet.
Upon this evidence of Athenian weakness, and the superiority of the
enemy, the Teians admitted into their town the land-force without;
by the help of which, they now demolished the wall formerly built by
Athens to protect the city against attack from the interior. Some
of the troops of Tissaphernês lending their aid in the demolition,
the town was laid altogether open to the satrap; who, moreover, came
himself shortly afterwards to complete the work.<a id="FNanchor_567"
href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p>Having themselves revolted from Athens, the Chian government
were prompted by considerations of their own safety to instigate
revolt in all other Athenian dependencies; and Alkibiadês<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[p. 375]</span> now took advantage
of their forwardness in the cause to make an attempt on Milêtus.
He was eager to acquire this important city, the first among all
the continental allies of Athens, by his own resources and those
of Chios, before the fleet could arrive from Peiræum; in order
that the glory of the exploit might be insured to Endius, and not
to Agis. Accordingly, he and Chalkideus left Chios with a fleet of
twenty-five triremes, twenty of them Chian, together with the five
which they themselves had brought from Laconia: these last five had
been remanned with Chian crews, the Peloponnesian crews having been
armed as hoplites and left as garrison in the island. Conducting
his voyage as secretly as possible, he was fortunate enough to pass
unobserved by the Athenian station at Samos, where Strombichidês had
just been reinforced by Thrasyklês with the twelve fresh triremes
from the blockading fleet at Peiræum. Arriving at Milêtus, where he
possessed established connections among the leading men, and had
already laid his train, as at Chios, for revolt, Alkibiadês prevailed
on them to break with Athens forthwith: so that when Strombichidês
and Thrasyklês, who came in pursuit the moment they learned his
movements, approached, they found the port shut against them, and
were forced to take up a station on the neighboring island of Ladê.
So anxious were the Chians for the success of Alkibiadês in this
enterprise, that they advanced with ten fresh triremes along the
Asiatic coast as far as Anæa, opposite to Samos, in order to hear
the result and to render aid if required. A message from Chalkideus
apprized them that he was master of Milêtus, and that Amorgês, the
Persian ally of Athens at Iasus, was on his way at the head of an
army; upon which they returned to Chios, but were unexpectedly seen
in the way—off the temple of Zeus, between Lebedos and Kolophon—and
pursued, by sixteen fresh ships just arrived from Athens, under the
command of Diomedon. Of the ten Chian triremes, one found refuge at
Ephesus, and five at Teos: the remaining four were obliged to run
ashore and became prizes, though the crews all escaped. In spite of
this check, however, the Chians came out again with fresh ships and
some land-forces, as soon as the Athenian fleet had gone back to
Samos, and procured the revolt both of Lebedos and Eræ from Athens.<a
id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[p. 376]</span></p> <p>It was
at Milêtus, immediately after the revolt, that the first treaty was
concluded between Tissaphernês, on behalf of himself and the Great
King, and Chalkideus, for Sparta and her allies. Probably the aid
of Tissaphernês was considered necessary to maintain the town, when
the Athenian fleet was watching it so closely on the neighboring
island: at least it is difficult to explain otherwise an agreement so
eminently dishonorable as well as disadvantageous to the Greeks:—</p>

<p>“The Lacedæmonians and their allies have concluded alliance with
the Great King and Tissaphernês, on the following conditions: The
king shall possess whatever territories and cities he himself had,
or his predecessors had before him. The king, and the Lacedæmonians
with their allies, shall jointly hinder the Athenians from deriving
either money or other advantages from all those cities which have
hitherto furnished to them any such. They shall jointly carry on war
against the Athenians, and shall not renounce the war against them,
except by joint consent. Whoever shall revolt from the king, shall be
treated as an enemy by the Lacedæmonians and their allies; whoever
shall revolt from the Lacedæmonians, shall in like manner be treated
as an enemy by the king.”<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569"
class="fnanchor">[569]</a></p>

<p>As a first step to the execution of this treaty, Milêtus was
handed over to Tissaphernês, who immediately caused a citadel to
be erected and placed a garrison within it.<a id="FNanchor_570"
href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> If fully carried
out, indeed, the terms of the treaty would have made the Great King
master not only of all the Asiatic Greeks and all the islanders
in the Ægean, but also of all Thessaly and Bœotia, and the full
ground which had once been covered by Xerxes.<a id="FNanchor_571"
href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> Besides this
monstrous stipulation, the treaty farther bound the Lacedæmonians
to aid the king in keeping enslaved any Greeks who might be under
his dominion. Nor did it, on the other hand, secure to them any
pecuniary aid from him for the payment of their armament, which was
their great motive for courting his alliance. We shall find the
Lacedæmonian authorities themselves hereafter refusing to ratify
the treaty, on the ground of its exorbitant concessions. But it
stands as a melancholy evidence of the new<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_377">[p. 377]</span> source of mischief now opening upon
the Asiatic and insular Greeks, the moment that the empire of Athens
was broken up, the revived pretensions of their ancient lord and
master; whom nothing had hitherto kept in check, for the last fifty
years, except Athens, first as representative and executive agent,
next as successor and mistress, of the confederacy of Delos. We thus
see against what evils Athens had hitherto protected them: we shall
presently see, what is partially disclosed in this very treaty, the
manner in which Sparta realized her promise of conferring autonomy on
each separate Grecian state.</p>

<p>The great stress of the war had now been transferred to Ionia
and the Asiatic side of the Ægean sea. The enemies of Athens had
anticipated that her entire empire in that quarter would fall an
easy prey: yet in spite of two such serious defections as Chios and
Milêtus, she showed an unexpected energy in keeping hold of the
remainder. Her great and capital station, from the present time to
the end of the war, was Samos; and a revolution which now happened,
insuring the fidelity of that island to her alliance, was a condition
indispensable to her power of maintaining the struggle in Ionia.</p>

<p>We have heard nothing about Samos throughout the whole war,
since its reconquest by the Athenians after the revolt of 440
<small>B.C.</small>: but we now find it under the government of
an oligarchy called the Geômori, the proprietors of land, as at
Syracuse before the rule of Gelon. It cannot be doubted that these
geômori were disposed to follow the example of the Chian oligarchy,
and revolt from Athens, while the people at Samos, as at Chios,
were averse to such a change. Under this state of circumstances,
the Chian oligarchy had themselves conspired with Sparta, to trick
and constrain their Demos by surprise into revolt, through the aid
of five Peloponnesian ships. The like would have happened at Samos,
had the people remained quiet. But they profited by the recent
warning, forestalled the designs of their oligarchy, and rose in
insurrection, with the help of three Athenian triremes which then
chanced to be in the port. The oligarchy were completely defeated,
but not without a violent and bloody struggle; two hundred of them
being slain, and four hundred banished. This revolution secured—and
probably nothing less than a democratical revolution could have
secured, under the existing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[p.
378]</span> state of Hellenic affairs—the adherence of Samos to the
Athenians; who immediately recognized the new democracy, and granted
to it the privilege of an equal and autonomous ally. The Samian
people confiscated and divided among themselves the property of
such of the geômori as were slain or banished:<a id="FNanchor_572"
href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> the remainder were
deprived of all political privileges, and were even forbidden to
intermarry with any of the families of the remaining citizens.<a
id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>
We may fairly suspect that this latter prohibition is<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[p. 379]</span> only the retaliation
of a similar exclusion which the oligarchy, when in power, had
enforced to maintain the purity of their own<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_380">[p. 380]</span> blood. What they had enacted as a
privilege was now thrown back upon them as an insult.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[p. 381]</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, the Athenian blockading fleet was surprised and
defeated, with the loss of four triremes, by the Peloponnesian<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[p. 382]</span> fleet at Peiræum, which
was thus enabled to get to Kenchreæ, and to refit in order that it
might be sent to Ionia. The sixteen Peloponnesian ships which had
fought at Syracuse had already come back to Lechæum, in spite of
the obstructions thrown in their way by the Athenian squadron under
Hippoklês at Naupaktus.<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574"
class="fnanchor">[574]</a> The Lacedæmonian admiral Astyochus
was sent to Kenchreæ to take the command and proceed to Ionia as
admiral-in-chief: but it was some time before he could depart
for Chios, whither he arrived with only four triremes, followed
by six more afterwards.<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575"
class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p>Before he reached that island, however, the Chians, zealous in the
new part which they had taken up, and interested for their own safety
in multiplying defections from Athens, had themselves undertaken the
prosecution of the plans concerted by Agis and the Lacedæmonians at
Corinth. They originated an expedition of their own, with thirteen
triremes under a Lacedæmonian periœkus named Deiniadas, to procure
the revolt of Lesbos; with the view, if successful, of proceeding
afterwards to do the same among the Hellespontine dependencies of
Athens. A land force under the Spartan Eualas, partly Peloponnesian,
partly Asiatic, marched along the coast of the mainland northward
towards Kymê, to coöperate in both these objects. Lesbos was at
this time divided into at least five separate city governments;
Methymna at the north of the island, Mitylênê towards the south-east,
Antissa, Eresus, and Pyrrha on the west. Whether these governments
were oligarchical or democratical we do not know, but the Athenian
kleruchs who had been sent to Mitylênê after<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_383">[p. 383]</span> its revolt sixteen years before, must
have long ago disappeared.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576"
class="fnanchor">[576]</a> The Chian fleet first went to Methymna
and procured the revolt of that place, where four triremes were left
in guard, while the remaining nine sailed forward to Mitylênê, and
succeeded in obtaining that important town also.<a id="FNanchor_577"
href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></p>

<p>Their proceedings, however, were not unwatched by the Athenian
fleet at Samos. Unable to recover possession of Teos, Diomedon had
been obliged to content himself with procuring neutrality from
that town, and admission for the vessels of Athens as well as of
her enemies: he had, moreover, failed in an attack upon Eræ.<a
id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> But
he had since been strengthened partly by the democratical revolution
at Samos, partly by the arrival of Leon with ten additional triremes
from Athens: so that these two commanders were now enabled to
sail, with twenty-five triremes, to the relief of Lesbos. Reaching
Mitylênê—the largest town in that island—very shortly after its
revolt, they sailed straight into the harbor when no one expected
them, seized the nine Chian ships with little resistance, and after
a successful battle on shore, regained possession of the city. The
Lacedæmonian admiral Astyochus—who had only been three days arrived
at Chios from Kenchreæ with his four triremes—saw the Athenian fleet
pass through the channel between Chios and the mainland, on its way
to Lesbos; and immediately on the same evening followed it to that
island, to lend what aid he could, with one Chian trireme added to
his own four, and some hoplites aboard. He sailed first to Pyrrha,
and on the next day to Eresus, on the west side of the island, where
he first learned the recapture of Mitylênê by the Athenians. He was
here also joined by three out of the four Chian triremes which had
been left to defend that place, and which had been driven away, with
the loss of one of their number, by a portion of the Athenian fleet
pushing on thither from Mitylênê. Astyochus prevailed on Eresus to
revolt from Athens, and having armed the population, sent them by
land together with his own hoplites under Eteonikus to Methymna,
in hopes of preserving that place, whither he also proceeded with
his fleet along the coast. But in spite of all his endeavors,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[p. 384]</span> Methymna as well as
Eresus and all Lesbos was recovered by the Athenians, while he
himself was obliged to return with his forces to Chios. The land
troops which had marched along the mainland, with a view to farther
operations at the Hellespont, were carried back to Chios and to
their respective homes.<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579"
class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<p>The recovery of Lesbos, which the Athenians now placed in a better
posture of defence, was of great importance in itself, and arrested
for the moment all operations against them at the Hellespont. Their
fleet from Lesbos was first employed in the recovery of Klazomenæ,
which they again carried back to its original islet near the shore;
the new town on the mainland, called Polichna, though in course
of being built, being not yet sufficiently<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_385">[p. 385]</span> fortified to defend itself. The leading
anti-Athenians in the town made their escape, and went farther up
the country to Daphnûs. Animated by such additional success—as well
as by a victory which the Athenians, who were blockading Milêtus,
gained over Chalkideus, wherein that officer was slain—Leon and
Diomedon thought themselves in a condition to begin aggressive
measures against Chios, now their most active enemy in Ionia. Their
fleet of twenty-five sail was well equipped with epibatæ; who, though
under ordinary circumstances they were thêtes armed at the public
cost, yet in the present stress of affairs were impressed from the
superior hoplites in the city muster-roll.<a id="FNanchor_580"
href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> They occupied the
little islets called Œnussæ, near Chios on the northeast, as well as
the forts of Sidussa and Pteleus in the territory of Erythræ; from
which positions they began a series of harassing operations against
Chios itself. Disembarking on the island at Kardamylê and Bolissus,
they not only ravaged the neighborhood, but inflicted upon the Chian
forces a bloody defeat. After two farther defeats, at Phanæ and at
Leukonium, the Chians no longer dared to quit their fortifications;
so that the invaders were left to ravage at pleasure the whole
territory, being at the same time masters of the sea around, and
blocking up the port.</p>

<p>The Athenians now retaliated upon Chios the hardships under
which Attica itself was suffering; hardships the more painfully
felt, inasmuch as this was the first time that an enemy had ever
been seen in the island since the repulse of Xerxês from Greece
and the organization of the confederacy of Delos, more than sixty
years before. The territory of Chios was highly cultivated,<a
id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>
its commerce extensive, and its wealth among the greatest in all
Greece. In fact, under the Athenian empire, its prosperity had
been so marked and so uninterrupted, that Thucydidês expresses his
astonishment at the undeviating prudence and circumspection of the
government, in spite of circumstances well calculated to tempt them
into extravagance. “Except Sparta (he says),<a id="FNanchor_582"
href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> Chios is the
only state that I know,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[p.
386]</span> which maintained its sober judgment throughout a career
of prosperity, and became even more watchful in regard to security,
in proportion as it advanced in power.” He adds, that the step of
revolting from Athens, though the Chian government now discovered it
to have been an error, was at any rate a pardonable error; for it
was undertaken under the impression, universal throughout Greece,
and prevalent even in Athens herself after the disaster at Syracuse,
that Athenian power, if not Athenian independence, was at an end, and
undertaken in conjunction with allies seemingly more than sufficient
to sustain it. This remarkable observation of Thucydidês doubtless
includes an indirect censure upon his own city, as abusing her
prosperity for purposes of unmeasured aggrandizement: a censure not
undeserved in reference to the enterprise against Sicily. But it
counts at the same time as a valuable testimony to the condition of
the allies of Athens under the Athenian empire, and goes far in reply
to the charge of practical oppression against the imperial city.</p>

<p>The operations now carrying on in Chios indicated such an
unexpected renovation in Athenian affairs, that a party in the
island began to declare in favor of reunion with Athens. The
Chian government were forced to summon Astyochus, with his four
Peloponnesian ships from Erythræ, to strengthen their hands, and keep
down opposition, by seizing hostages from the suspected parties, as
well as by other precautions. While the Chians were thus endangered
at home, the Athenian interest in Ionia was still farther fortified
by the arrival of a fresh armament from Athens at Samos. Phrynichus,
Onomaklês, and Skironidês conducted a fleet of forty-eight triremes,
some of them employed for the transportation of hoplites; of which
latter there were aboard one thousand Athenians, and fifteen hundred
Argeians. Five hundred of these Argeians, having come to Athens
without arms, were clothed with Athenian panoplies for service. The
newly-arrived armament immediately sailed from Samos to Milêtus,
where it effected a disembarkation, in conjunction with those<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[p. 387]</span> Athenians who had been
before watching the place from the island of Ladê. The Milêsians
marched forth to give them battle; mustering eight hundred of
their own hoplites, together with the Peloponnesian seamen of the
five triremes brought across by Chalkideus, and a body of troops,
chiefly cavalry, yet with a few mercenary hoplites, under the satrap
Tissaphernês. Alkibiadês, also, was present and engaged. The Argeians
were so full of contempt for the Ionians of Milêtus who stood
opposite to them, that they rushed forward to the charge with great
neglect of rank or order; a presumption which they expiated by an
entire defeat, with the loss of three hundred men. But the Athenians
on their wing were so completely victorious over the Peloponnesians
and others opposed to them, that all the army of the latter, and
even the Milesians themselves on returning from their pursuit of the
Argeians, were forced to shelter themselves within the walls of the
town. The issue of this combat excited much astonishment, inasmuch
as, on each side, Ionian hoplites were victorious over Dorian.<a
id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p>

<p>For a moment, the Athenian army, masters of the field under the
walls of Milêtus, indulged the hope of putting that city under
blockade, by a wall across the isthmus which connected it with the
continent. But these hopes soon vanished when they were apprized,
on the very evening of the battle, that the main Peloponnesian and
Sicilian fleet, fifty-five triremes in number, was actually in sight.
Of these fifty-five, twenty-two were Sicilian,—twenty from Syracuse
and two from Selinus,—sent at the pressing instance of Hermokratês,
and under his command, for the purpose of striking the final blow
at Athens; so at least it was anticipated, in the beginning of 412
<small>B.C.</small> The remaining thirty-three triremes
being Peloponnesian, the whole fleet was placed under the temporary
command of Theramenês, until he could join the admiral Astyochus.
Theramenês, halting first at the island of Lerus,—off the coast,
towards the southward of Milêtus,—was there first informed of the
recent victory of the Athenians, so that he thought it prudent to
take station for the night in the neighboring gulf of Iasus. Here
he was found by Alkibiadês, who came on horseback, in all haste,
from Milêtus to the Milesian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[p.
388]</span> town of Teichiussa on that gulf. Alkibiadês strenuously
urged him to lend immediate aid to the Milêsians, so as to prevent
the construction of the intended wall of blockade; representing that
if that city were captured, all the hopes of the Peloponnesians
in Ionia would be extinguished. Accordingly, he prepared to sail
thither the next morning: but, during the night, the Athenians
thought it wise to abandon their position near Milêtus and return
to Samos with their wounded and their baggage. Having heard of the
arrival of Theramenês with his fleet, they preferred leaving their
victory unimproved, to the hazard of a general battle. Two out of
the three commanders, indeed, were at first inclined to take the
latter course, insisting that the maritime honor of Athens would be
tarnished by retiring before the enemy. But the third, Phrynichus,
opposed with so much emphasis the proposition of fighting, that he
at length induced his colleagues to retire. The fleet, he said, had
not come prepared for fighting a naval battle, but full of hoplites
for land-operations against Milêtus: the numbers of the newly-arrived
Peloponnesians were not accurately known; and a defeat at sea, under
existing circumstances, would be utter ruin to Athens. Thucydidês
bestows much praise on Phrynichus for the wisdom of this advice,
which was forthwith acted upon. The Athenian fleet sailed back to
Samos; from which place the Argeian hoplites, sulky with their
recent defeat, demanded to be conveyed home.<a id="FNanchor_584"
href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>On the ensuing morning, the Peloponnesian fleet sailed from the
gulf of Iasus to Milêtus, expecting to find and fight the Athenians,
and leaving their masts, sails, and rigging—as was usual when going
into action—at Teichiussa. Finding Milêtus already relieved of
the enemy, they stayed there only one day, in order to reinforce
themselves with the twenty-five triremes which Chalkideus had
originally brought thither, and which had been since blocked up
by the Athenian fleet at Ladê, and then sailed back to Teichiussa
to pick up the tackle there deposited. Being now not far from
Iasus, the residence of Amorgês, Tissaphernês persuaded them to
attack it by sea, in coöperation with his forces by land. No one
at Iasus was aware of the arrival of the Peloponnesian fleet: the
triremes approaching were supposed to be<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_389">[p. 389]</span> Athenians and friends, so that the
place was entered and taken by surprise;<a id="FNanchor_585"
href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> though strong in
situation and fortifications, and defended by a powerful band of
Grecian mercenaries. The capture of Iasus, in which the Syracusans
distinguished themselves, was of signal advantage, from the abundant
plunder which it distributed among the army; the place being rich
from ancient date, and probably containing the accumulations of
the satrap Pissuthnês, father of Amorgês. It was handed over to
Tissaphernês, along with all the prisoners, for each head of whom he
paid down a Daric stater, or twenty Attic drachmæ, and along with
Amorgês himself, who had been taken alive, and whom the satrap was
thus enabled to send up to Susa. The Grecian mercenaries captured
in the place were enrolled in the service of the captors, and sent
by land under Pedaritus to Erythræ, in order that they might cross
over from thence to Chios.<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586"
class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<p>The arrival of the recent reinforcements to both the opposing
fleets, and the capture of Iasus, took place about the autumnal
equinox or the end of September; at which period, the Peloponnesian
fleet being assembled at Milêtus, Tissaphernês paid to them the
wages of the crews, at the rate of one Attic drachma per head per
diem, as he had promised by his envoy at Sparta. But he at the
same time gave notice for the future,—partly at the instigation of
Alkibiadês, of which more hereafter,—that he could not continue so
high a rate of pay, unless he should receive express instructions
from Susa; and that, until such instructions came, he should give
only half a drachma per day. Theramenês, being only commander for
the interim, until the junction with Astyochus, was indifferent
to the rate at which the men were paid,—a miserable jealousy,
which marks the low character of many of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_390">[p. 390]</span> these Spartan officers,—but the
Syracusan Hermokratês remonstrated so loudly against the reduction,
that he obtained from Tissaphernês the promise of a slight increase
above the half drachma, though he could not succeed in getting the
entire drachma continued.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587"
class="fnanchor">[587]</a> For the present, however, the seamen
were in good spirits; not merely from having received the high rate
of pay, but from the plentiful booty recently acquired at Iasus;<a
id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
while Astyochus and the Chians were also greatly encouraged by
the arrival of so large a fleet. Nevertheless, the Athenians on
their side were also reinforced by thirty-five fresh triremes,
which reached Samos under Strombichidês, Charminus, and Euktêmon.
The Athenian fleet from Chios was now recalled to Samos, where
the commanders mustered their whole naval force, with a view of
redividing it for ulterior operations.</p>

<p>Considering that in the autumn of the preceding year, immediately
after the Syracusan disaster, the navy of Athens had been no less
scanty in number of ships than defective in equipment, we read
with amazement, that she had now at Samos no less than one hundred
and four triremes in full condition and disposable for service,
besides some others specially destined for the transport of troops.
Indeed, the total number which she had sent out, putting together
the separate squadrons, had been one hundred and twenty-eight.<a
id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> So
energetic an effort, and so unexpected a renovation of affairs from
the hopeless prostration of last year, was such as no Grecian state
except Athens could have accomplished; nor even Athens herself, had
she not been aided by that reserve fund, consecrated twenty years
before through the long-sighted calculation of Periklês.</p>

<p>The Athenians resolved to employ thirty triremes in making a
landing, and establishing a fortified post, in Chios; and lots
being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[p. 391]</span> drawn
among the generals, Strombichidês with two others were assigned to
the command. The other seventy-four triremes, remaining masters of
the sea, made descents near Milêtus, and in vain tried to provoke
the Peloponnesian fleet out of that harbor. It was some time before
Astyochus actually went thither to assume his new command, being
engaged in operations near to Chios, which island had been left
comparatively free by the recall of the Athenian fleet to the general
muster at Samos. Going forth with twenty triremes,—ten Peloponnesian
and ten Chian,—he made a fruitless attack upon Pteleus, the Athenian
fortified post in the Erythræan territory; after which he sailed
to Klazomenæ, recently retransferred from the continent to the
neighboring islet. He here—in conjunction with Tamôs, the Persian
general of the district—enjoined the Klazomenians again to break
with Athens, to leave their islet, and to take up their residence
inland at Daphnûs, where the philo-Peloponnesian party among them
still remained established since the former revolt. This demand being
rejected, he attacked Klazomenæ, but was repulsed, although the town
was unfortified, and was presently driven off by a severe storm,
from which he found shelter at Kymê and Phokæa. Some of his ships
sheltered themselves during the same storm on certain islets near
to and belonging to Klazomenæ; on which they remained eight days,
destroying and plundering the property of the inhabitants, and then
rejoined Astyochus. That admiral was now anxious to make an attempt
on Lesbos, from which he received envoys promising revolt from
Athens. But the Corinthians and others in his fleet were so averse to
the enterprise, that he was forced to relinquish it and sail back to
Chios; his fleet, before it arrived there, being again dispersed by
the storms, frequent in the month of November.<a id="FNanchor_590"
href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Pedaritus, despatched by land from Milêtus,—at the
head of the mercenary force made prisoners at Iasus, as well as of
five hundred of the Peloponnesian seamen who had originally crossed
the sea with Chalkideus, and since served as hoplites,—had reached
Erythræ and from thence crossed the channel to Chios. To him and
to the Chians, Astyochus now proposed to undertake the expedition
to Lesbos; but he experi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[p.
392]</span>enced from them the same reluctance as from the
Corinthians, a strong proof that the tone of feeling in Lesbos had
been found to be decidedly philo-Athenian on the former expedition.
Pedaritus even peremptorily refused to let him have the Chian
triremes for any such purpose, an act of direct insubordination in a
Lacedæmonian officer towards the admiral-in-chief, which Astyochus
resented so strongly, that he immediately left Chios for Milêtus,
carrying away with him all the Peloponnesian triremes, and telling
the Chians, in terms of strong displeasure, that they might look
in vain to him for aid, if they should come to need it. He halted
with his fleet for the night under the headland of Korykus (in
the Erythræan territory), on the north side; but while there, he
received an intimation of a supposed plot to betray Erythræ by
means of prisoners sent back from the Athenian station at Samos.
Instead of pursuing his voyage to Milêtus, he therefore returned
on the next day to Erythræ to investigate this plot, which turned
out to be a stratagem of the prisoners themselves in order to
obtain their liberation.<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591"
class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p>The fact of his thus going back to Erythræ, instead of pursuing
his voyage, proved, by accident, the salvation of his fleet. For
it so happened that on that same night the Athenian fleet, under
Strombichidês—thirty triremes, accompanied by some triremes carrying
hoplites—had its station on the southern side of the same headland.
Neither knew of the position of the other, and Astyochus, had he gone
forward the next day towards Milêtus, would have fallen in with the
superior numbers of his enemy. He farther escaped a terrible storm,
which the Athenians encountered when they doubled the headland going
northward. Descrying three Chian triremes, they gave chase, but the
storm became so violent that even these Chians had great difficulty
in making their own harbor, while the three foremost Athenian ships
were wrecked on the neighboring shore, all the crews either perishing
or becoming prisoners.<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592"
class="fnanchor">[592]</a> The rest of the Athenian fleet found
shelter in the harbor of Phœnikus on the opposite mainland, under the
lofty mountain called Mimas, north of Erythræ.</p>

<p>As soon as weather permitted, they pursued their voyage to
Lesbos, from which island they commenced their operations of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[p. 393]</span> invading Chios and
establishing in it a permanent fortified post. Having transported
their land-force across from Lesbos, they occupied a strong maritime
site called Delphinium, seemingly a projecting cape having a
sheltered harbor on each side, not far from the city of Chios.<a
id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>
They bestowed great labor and time in fortifying this post, both on
the land and the sea-side, during which process they were scarcely
interrupted at all either by the Chians, or by Pedaritus and his
garrison; whose inaction arose not merely from the discouragement of
the previous defeats, but from the political dissension which now
reigned in the city. A strong philo-Athenian party had pronounced
itself; and though Tydeus its leader was seized by Pedaritus and
put to death, still, his remaining partisans were so numerous, that
the government was brought to an oligarchy narrower than ever, and
to the extreme of jealous precaution, not knowing whom to trust.
In spite of numerous messages sent to Milêtus, intreating succor,
and representing the urgent peril to which this greatest among all
the Ionian allies of Sparta was exposed, Astyochus adhered to his
parting menaces, and refused compliance. The indignant Pedaritus sent
to prefer complaint against him at Sparta as a traitor. Meanwhile
the fortress at Delphinium advanced so near towards completion,
that Chios began to suffer from it as much as Athens suffered from
Dekeleia, with the farther misfortune of being blocked up by sea.
The slaves in this wealthy island—chiefly foreigners acquired by
purchase, but more numerous than in any other Grecian state except
Laconia—were emboldened by the manifest superiority and assured
position of the invaders to desert in crowds; and the loss arising,
not merely from their flight, but from the valuable information and
aid which they gave to the enemy was immense.<a id="FNanchor_594"
href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> The dis<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[p. 394]</span>tress of the island
increased every day, nor could anything relieve it except succor from
without, which Astyochus still withheld.</p>

<p>That officer, on reaching Milêtus, found the Peloponnesian
force on the Asiatic side of the Ægean just reinforced by a
squadron of twelve triremes under Dorieus; chiefly from Thurii,
which had undergone a political revolution since the Athenian
disaster at Syracuse, and was now decidedly in the hands of the
active philo-Laconian party; the chief persons friendly to Athens
having been exiled.<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595"
class="fnanchor">[595]</a> Dorieus and his squadron, crossing the
Ægean in its southern latitude, had arrived safely at Knidus, which
had already been conquered by Tissaphernês from Athens, and had
received a Persian garrison.<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596"
class="fnanchor">[596]</a> Orders were sent from Milêtus that half of
this newly-arrived squadron should remain on guard at Knidus, while
the other half should cruise near the Triopian cape to intercept the
trading vessels from Egypt. But the Athenians, who had also learned
the arrival of Dorieus, sent a powerful squadron from Samos, which
captured all these six triremes off Cape Triopium, though the crews
escaped ashore. They farther made an attempt to recover Knidus,
which was very nearly successful, as the town was unfortified on
the sea-side. On the morrow the attack was renewed,—but additional
defences had been provided during the night, while the crews of
the ships captured near Triopium had come in to help,—so that
the Athenians were forced to return to Samos without any farther
advantage than that of ravaging the Knidian territory. Astyochus took
no step to intercept them, nor did he think himself strong enough to
keep the sea against the seventy-four Athenian triremes at Samos,
though his fleet at Milêtus was at this moment in high condition.
The rich booty acquired at Iasus was uncon<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_395">[p. 395]</span>sumed; the Milêsians were zealous in
the confederate cause; while the pay from Tissaphernês continued to
be supplied with tolerable regularity, though at the reduced rate
mentioned a little above.<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597"
class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>Though the Peloponnesians had yet no ground of complaint—such
as they soon came to have—against the satrap for irregularity of
payment, still, the powerful fleet now at Milêtus inspired the
commanders with a new tone of confidence, so that they became
ashamed of the stipulations of that treaty to which Chalkideus and
Alkibiadês, when first landing at Milêtus with their scanty armament,
had submitted. Accordingly Astyochus, shortly after his arrival at
Milêtus, and even before the departure of Theramenês,—whose functions
had expired when he had handed over the fleet,—insisted on a fresh
treaty with Tissaphernês, which was agreed on, to the following
effect:—</p>

<p>“Convention and alliance is concluded, on the following
conditions, between the Lacedæmonians, with their allies, and king
Darius, his sons, and Tissaphernês. The Lacedæmonians and their
allies shall not attack or injure any territory or any city which
belongs to Darius, or has belonged to his father or ancestors;
nor shall they raise any tribute from any of the said cities.
Neither Darius nor any of his subjects shall attack or injure the
Lacedæmonians or their allies. Should the Lacedæmonians or their
allies have any occasion for the king, or should the king have any
occasion for the Lacedæmonians or their allies, let each meet,
as much as may be, the wishes expressed by the other. Both will
carry on jointly the war against Athens and her allies: neither
party shall bring the war to a close, without mutual consent.
The king shall pay and keep any army which he may have sent for,
and which may be employed in his territory. If any of the cities
parties to this convention shall attack the king’s territory, the
rest engage to hinder them, and to defend the king with their best
power. And if any one within the king’s territory, or within the
territory subject to him,<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598"
class="fnanchor">[598]</a> shall attack the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_396">[p. 396]</span> Lacedæmonians or their allies, the king
shall hinder them, and lend his best defensive aid.”</p>

<p>Looked at with the eyes of Pan-Hellenic patriotism, this second
treaty of Astyochus and Theramenês was less disgraceful than the
first treaty of Chalkideus. It did not formally proclaim that all
those Grecian cities which had ever belonged to the king or to his
ancestors, should still be considered as his subjects, nor did
it pledge the Lacedæmonians to aid the king in hindering any of
them from achieving their liberty. It still admitted, however, by
implication, the same undiminished extent of the king’s dominion,
as it had stood when at its maximum under his predecessors; the
same undefined rights of the king to meddle with Grecian affairs;
the same unqualified abandonment of all the Greeks on the continent
of Asia. The conclusion of this treaty was the last act performed
by Theramenês, who was lost at sea shortly afterwards, on his
voyage home, in a small boat, no one knew how.<a id="FNanchor_599"
href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>Astyochus, now alone in command, was still importuned by the
urgent solicitations of the distressed Chians for relief, and, in
spite of his reluctance, was compelled by the murmurs of his own
army to lend an ear to them, when a new incident happened which gave
him at least a good pretext for directing his attention southward. A
Peloponnesian squadron of twenty-seven triremes under the command of
Antisthenês, having started from Cape Malea about the winter tropic
or close of 412 <small>B.C.</small>, had first crossed
the sea to Melos, where it dispersed ten Athenian triremes and
captured three of them; then afterwards, from apprehension that these
fugitive Athenians would make known its approach at Samos, had made
a long circuit round by Krete, and thus ultimately reached Kaunus
at the southeastern extremity of Asia Minor. This was the squadron
which Kalligeitus and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[p.
397]</span> Timagoras had caused to be equipped, having come over for
that purpose a year before as envoys from the satrap Pharnabazus.
Antisthenês was instructed first to get to Milêtus and put himself
in concert with the main Lacedæmonian fleet; next, to forward these
triremes, or another squadron of equal force under Klearchus, to the
Hellespont, for the purpose of coöperating with Pharnabazus against
the Athenian dependencies in that region. Eleven Spartans, the
chief of whom was Lichas, accompanied Antisthenês, to be attached
to Astyochus as advisers, according to a practice not unusual with
the Lacedæmonians. These men were not only directed to review the
state of affairs at Milêtus, and exercise control coördinate with
Astyochus, but even empowered, if they saw reason, to dismiss that
admiral himself, upon whom the complaints of Pedaritus from Chios
had cast suspicion; and to appoint Antisthenês in his place.<a
id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<p>No sooner had Astyochus learned at Milêtus the arrival of
Antisthenês at Kaunus, than he postponed all idea of lending aid
to Chios, and sailed immediately to secure his junction with
the twenty-seven new triremes as well as with the new Spartan
counsellors. In his voyage southward he captured the city of Kôs,
unfortified and half-ruined by a recent earthquake, and then passed
on to Knidus; where the inhabitants strenuously urged him to go
forward at once, even without disembarking his men, in order that
he might surprise an Athenian squadron of twenty triremes under
Charmînus; which had been despatched from Samos, after the news
received from Melos, in order to attack and repel the squadron under
Antisthenês. Charmînus, having his station at Symê, was cruising
near Rhodes and the Lykian coast, to watch, though he had not been
able to keep back, the Peloponnesian fleet just arrived at Kaunus.
In this position he was found by the far more numerous fleet of
Astyochus, the approach of which he did not at all expect. But the
rainy and hazy weather had so dispersed it, that Charmînus, seeing
at first only a few ships apart from the rest, mistook them for the
smaller squadron of new-comers. Attacking the triremes thus seen, he
at first gained considerable advantage, dis<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_398">[p. 398]</span>abling three and damaging several
others. But presently the dispersed vessels of the main fleet
came in sight and closed round him, so that he was forced to make
the best speed in escaping, first to the island called Teutlussa,
next to Halikarnassus. He did not effect his escape without the
loss of six ships; while the victorious Peloponnesians, after
erecting their trophy on the island of Symê, returned to Knidus,
where the entire fleet, including the twenty-seven triremes newly
arrived, was now united.<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601"
class="fnanchor">[601]</a> The Athenians in Samos—whose affairs were
now in confusion, from causes which will be explained in the ensuing
chapter—had kept no watch on the movements of the main Peloponnesian
fleet at Milêtus, and seem to have been ignorant of its departure
until they were apprized of the defeat of Charmînus. They then
sailed down to Symê, took up the sails and rigging belonging to that
squadron, which had been there deposited, and then, after an attack
upon Loryma, carried back their whole fleet, probably including the
remnant of the squadron of Charmînus, to Samos.<a id="FNanchor_602"
href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<p>Though the Peloponnesian fleet now assembled at Knidus consisted
of ninety-four triremes, much superior in number to the Athenian, it
did not try to provoke any general action. The time of Lichas and
his brother commissioners was at first spent in negotiations with
Tissaphernês, who had joined them at Knidus, and against whom they
found a strong feeling of discontent prevalent in the fleet. That
satrap—now acting greatly under the advice of Alkibiadês, of which
also more in the coming chapter—had of late become slack in the
Peloponnesian cause, and irregular in furnishing pay to their seamen,
during the last weeks of their stay at Milêtus. He was at the same
time full of promises, paralyzing all their operations by assurances
that he was bringing up the vast fleet of Phenicia to their aid: but
in reality his object was, under fair appearances, merely to prolong
the contest and waste the strength of both parties. Arriving in the
midst of this state of feeling, and discussing with Tissaphernês
the future conduct of the war, Lichas not only expressed dis<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[p. 399]</span>pleasure at his past
conduct, but even protested against the two conventions concluded by
Chalkideus and by Theramenês, as being, both the one and the other,
a disgrace to the Hellenic name. By the express terms of the former,
and by the implications of the latter, not merely all the islands
of the Ægean, but even Thessaly and Bœotia, were acknowledged as
subject to Persia; so that Sparta, if she sanctioned such conditions,
would be merely imposing upon the Greeks a Persian sceptre, instead
of general freedom, for which she professed to be struggling.
Lichas, declaring that he would rather renounce all prospect of
Persian pay, than submit to such conditions, proposed to negotiate
for a fresh treaty upon other and better terms, a proposition
which Tissaphernês rejected with so much indignation as to depart
without settling anything.<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603"
class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

<p>His desertion did not discourage the Peloponnesian counsellors.
Possessing a fleet larger than they had ever before had united in
Asia, together with a numerous body of allies, they calculated on
being able to get money to pay their men without Persian aid; and
an invitation, which they just now received from various powerful
men at Rhodes, tended to strengthen such confidence. The island of
Rhodes, inhabited by a Dorian population considerable in number as
well as distinguished for nautical skill, was at this time divided
between three separate city governments, as it had been at the epoch
of the Homeric Catalogue,—Lindus, Ialysus, and Kameirus; for the
city called Rhodes, formed by a coalescence of all these three,
dates only from two or three years after the period which we have
now reached. Invited by several of the wealthy men of the island,
the Peloponnesian fleet first attacked Kameirus, the population
of which, intimidated by a force of ninety-four triremes, and
altogether uninformed of their approach, abandoned their city, which
had no defences, and fled to the mountains.<a id="FNanchor_604"
href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> All the three
Rhodian towns, destitute of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[p.
400]</span> fortifications, were partly persuaded, partly frightened,
into the step of revolting from Athens and allying themselves with
the Peloponnesians. The Athenian fleet, whose commanders were just
now too busy with political intrigue to keep due military watch,
arrived from Samos too late to save Rhodes, and presently returned to
the former island, leaving detachments at Chalkê and Kôs to harass
the Peloponnesians with desultory attacks.</p>

<p>The Peloponnesians now levied from the Rhodians a contribution
of thirty-two talents, and adopted the island as the main station
for their fleet, instead of Milêtus. We can explain this change
of place by their recent unfriendly discussion with Tissaphernês,
and their desire to be more out of his reach.<a id="FNanchor_605"
href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> But what we
cannot so easily explain, is, that they remained on the island
without any movement or military action, and actually hauled
their triremes ashore, for the space of no less than eighty
days; that is, from about the middle of January to the end of
March 411 <small>B.C.</small> While their powerful
fleet of ninety-four triremes, superior to that of Athens at
Samos, was thus lying idle, their allies in Chios were known
to be suffering severe and increasing distress, and repeatedly
pressing for aid:<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606"
class="fnanchor">[606]</a> moreover, the promise of sending to
coöperate with Pharnabazus against the Athenian dependencies
on the Hellespont, remained unperformed.<a id="FNanchor_607"
href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> We may impute
such extreme military slackness mainly to the insidious policy of
Tissaphernês, now playing a double game between Sparta and Athens.
He still kept up intelligence with the Peloponnesians at Rhodes,
paralyzed their energies by assurances that the Phenician fleet
was actually on its way to aid them, and insured the success of
these intrigues by bribes distributed per<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_401">[p. 401]</span>sonally among the generals and the
trierarchs. Even Astyochus, the general-in-chief, took his share in
this corrupt bargain, against which not one stood out except the
Syracusan Hermokratês.<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608"
class="fnanchor">[608]</a> Such prolonged inaction of the armament,
at the moment of its greatest force, was thus not simply the fruit of
honest mistake, like the tardiness of Nikias in Sicily, but proceeded
from the dishonesty and personal avidity of the Peloponnesian
officers.</p>

<p>I have noticed, on more than one previous occasion, the many
evidences which exist of the prevalence of personal corruption—even
in its coarsest form, that of direct bribery—among the leading Greeks
of all the cities, when acting individually. Of such evidences the
incident here recorded is not the least remarkable. Nor ought this
general fact ever to be forgotten by those who discuss the question
between oligarchy and democracy, as it stood in the Grecian world.
The confident pretensions put forth by the wealthy and oligarchical
Greeks to superior virtue, public as well as private,—and the quiet
repetition, by various writers modern and ancient, of the laudatory
epithets implying such assumed virtue,—are so far from being borne
out by history, that these individuals were perpetually ready as
statesmen to betray their countrymen, or as generals even to betray
the interests of their soldiers, for the purpose of acquiring money
themselves. Of course, it is not meant that this was true of all of
them; but it was true sufficiently often, to be reckoned upon as a
contingency more than probable. If, speaking on the average, the
leading men of a Grecian community were not above the commission of
political misdeeds thus palpable, and of a nature not to be disguised
even from themselves, far less would they be above the vices, always
more or less mingled with self-delusion, of pride, power-seeking,
party-antipathy or sympathy, love of ease, etc. And if the community
were to have any chance of guarantee against such abuses, it could
only be by full license of accusation against delinquents,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[p. 402]</span> and certainty of trial
before judges identified in interest with the people themselves.
Such were the securities which the Grecian democracies, especially
that of Athens, tried to provide; in a manner not always wise, still
less always effectual, but assuredly justified, in the amplest
manner, by the urgency and prevalence of the evil. Yet in the common
representations given of Athenian affairs, this evil is overlooked
or evaded; the precautions taken against it are denounced as so many
evidences of democratical ill-temper and injustice; and the class
of men, through whose initiatory action alone such precautions were
enforced, are held up to scorn as demagogues and <i>sycophants</i>. Had
these Peloponnesian generals and trierarchs, who under the influence
of bribes wasted two important months in inaction, been Athenians,
there might have been some chance of their being tried and punished;
though even at Athens the chance of impunity to offenders, through
powerful political clubs and other sinister artifices, was much
greater than it ought to have been. So little is it consistent with
the truth, however often affirmed, that judicial accusation was too
easy, and judicial condemnation too frequent. When the judicial
precautions provided at Athens are looked at, as they ought to be,
side by side with the evil, they will be found imperfect, indeed,
both in the scheme and in the working, but certainly neither uncalled
for nor over-severe.</p>

<p>
He characterizes the Argeians as anxious for this reason to prolong
the war between Athens and Sparta. This passage, as well as the
whole tenor of the play, affords ground for affirming that the Pax
was represented during the winter immediately preceding the Peace of
Nikias, about four or five months after the battle of Amphipolis and
the death of Kleon and Brasidas; not two years later, as Mr. Clinton
would place it, on the authority of a date in the play itself, upon
which he lays too great stress.</p>

<p>
Diodorus (xii, 75) represents the first formation of this
Thousand-regiment at Argos as having taken place just about this
time, and I think he is here worthy of credit; so that I do not
regard the expression of Thucydidês ἐκ πολλοῦ as indicating a time
more than two years prior to the battle of Mantineia. For Grecian
military training, two years of constant practice would be a <i>long</i>
time. It is not to be imagined that the Argeian democracy would have
incurred the expense and danger of keeping up this select regiment
during all the period of their long peace, just now coming to an end.</p>

σφίσι τὴν Ἀργείων δημοκρατίαν αὐτοῖς ὀλιγαρχουμένοις ἧσσον ξύμφορον
εἶναι τῆς Λακεδαιμονίων πολιτείας.
</p>
<p>
These words, περιορώμενοι ὑπὸ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων, are not clear, and
have occasioned much embarrassment to the commentators, as well as
some propositions for altering the text. It would undoubtedly be
an improvement in the sense, if we were permitted (with Dobree) to
strike out the words ὑπὸ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων as a gloss, and thus to
construe περιορώμενοι as a middle verb, “waiting to see the event,”
or literally, “keeping a look-out about them.” But taking the text
as it now stands, the sense which I have given to it seems the best
which can be elicited.
</p>
<p>
Most of the critics translate περιορώμενοι “slighted or despised by
the Lacedæmonians.” But in the first place, this is not true as a
matter of fact: in the next place, if it were true, we ought to have
an adversative conjunction instead of καὶ before νομίζοντες, since
the tendency of the two motives indicated would then be in opposite
directions. “The Bœotians, though despised by the Lacedæmonians,
still thought a junction with the Argeian democracy dangerous.” And
this is the sense which Haack actually proposes, though it does great
violence to the word καὶ.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Thirlwall and Dr. Arnold translate περιορώμενοι “feeling
themselves slighted;” and the latter says, “The Bœotians and
Megarians took neither side; not the Lacedæmonian, for they felt that
the Lacedæmonians had slighted them; not the Argive, for they thought
that the Argive democracy would suit them less than the constitution
of Sparta.” But this again puts an inadmissible meaning on ἡσύχαζον,
which means “stood as they were.” The Bœotians were not called upon
to choose between two sides or two positive schemes of action: they
were invited to ally themselves with Argos, and this they decline
doing: they prefer to <i>remain as they are</i>, allies of Lacedæmon,
but refusing to become parties to the peace. Moreover, in the
sense proposed by Dr. Arnold, we should surely find an adversative
conjunction in place of καὶ.
</p>
<p>
I submit that the word περιορᾶν does not necessarily mean “to slight
or despise,” but sometimes “to leave alone, to take no notice of, to
abstain from interfering.” Thus, Thucyd. i, 24. Ἐπιδάμνιοι—πέμπουσιν
ἐς τὴν Κερκύραν πρέσβεις—δεόμενοι μὴ σφᾶς <em class="gesperrt">περιορᾶν</em>
φθειρομένους, etc. Again, i, 69, καὶ νῦν τοὺς Ἀθηναίους οὐχ ἑκάς ἀλλ’
ἐγγὺς ὄντας <em class="gesperrt">περιορᾶτε</em>, etc. The same is the sense of περιϊδεῖν
and περιόψεσθαι, ii, 20. In all these passages there is no idea of
<i>contempt</i> implied in the word: the “leaving alone” or “abstaining
from interference,” proceeds from feelings quite different from
contempt.
</p>
<p>
So in the passage here before us, περιορώμενοι seems the <i>passive</i>
participle in this sense. Thucydidês, having just described an
energetic remonstrance sent by the Spartans to prevent Corinth from
joining Argos, means to intimate (by the words here in discussion)
that <i>no</i> similar <i>interference</i> was resorted to by them to
prevent the Bœotians and Megarians from joining her: “The Bœotians
and Megarians remained as they were, <i>left to themselves by the
Lacedæmonians</i>, and thinking the Argeian democracy less suitable to
them than the oligarchy of Sparta.”</p>
</div>

</p>
<p>
Of the agreement here alluded to among the members of the
Peloponnesian confederacy, we hear only in this one passage. It was
extremely important to such of the confederates as were imperial
cities; that is, which had subordinates or subject-allies.
</p>
<p>
Poppo and Bloomfield wonder that the Corinthians did not appeal to
this agreement in order to procure the restitution of Sollium and
Anaktorium. But they misconceive the scope of the agreement, which
did not relate to captures made during the war by the common enemy.
It would be useless for the confederacy to enter into a formal
agreement that none of the members should lose anything through
capture made by the enemy. This would be a question of superiority
of force, for no agreement could bind the enemy. But the confederacy
might very well make a covenant among themselves, as to the relations
between their own imperial <i>immediate</i> members, and the <i>mediate</i>
or subordinate dependencies of each. Each imperial state consented
to forego the tribute or services of its dependency, so long as the
latter was called upon to lend its aid in the general effort of the
confederacy against the common enemy. But the confederacy at the
same time gave its guarantee, that the imperial state should reënter
upon these suspended rights, so soon as the war should be at an end.
This guarantee was clearly violated by Sparta in the case of Elis
and Lepreum. On the contrary, in the case of Mantineia, mentioned a
few pages back, p. 19, the Mantineians had violated the maxim of the
confederacy, and Sparta was justified in interfering at the request
of their subjects to maintain the autonomy of the latter.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_30"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_30">[30]</a></span> Thucyd. v, 32. Κορινθίοις δὲ ἀνακωχὴ ἄσπονδος ἦν πρὸς
Ἀθηναίους.
</p>
<p>
Upon which Dr. Arnold remarks: “By ἄσπονδος is meant a mere agreement
in words, not ratified by the solemnities of religion. And the
Greeks, as we have seen, considered the breach of their word very
different from the breach of their oath.”
</p>
<p>
Not so much is here meant even as that which Dr. Arnold supposes.
There was no agreement at all, either in words or by oath. There was
a simple absence of hostilities, <i>de facto</i>, not arising out of any
recognized pledge. Such is the meaning of ἀνακωχὴ, i, 66; iii, 25, 26.
</p>
<p>
The answer here made by the Athenians to the application of Corinth
is not easy to understand. They might, with much better reason, have
declined to conclude the ten day’s armistice with the <i>Bœotians</i>,
because these latter still remained allies of Sparta, though refusing
to accede to the general peace; whereas the Corinthians, having
joined Argos, had less right to be considered allies of Sparta.
Nevertheless, we shall still find them attending the meetings at
Sparta, and acting as allies of the latter.</p>

The same phrase is also found in the short extract from the λοιδορία
of Antipho (Athenæus, xii, p. 525).
</p>
<p>
The description of Alkibiadês, given in that Discourse called the
Ἐρωτικὸς Λόγος, erroneously ascribed to Demosthenês (c. 12, p.
1414), is more discriminating than we commonly find in rhetorical
compositions. Τοῦτο δ’, Ἀλκιβιάδην εὑρήσεις φύσει μὲν πρὸς ἀρετὴν
πολλῷ χεῖρον διακείμενον, καὶ τὰ μὲν ὑπερηφάνως, τὰ δὲ ταπεινῶς, τὰ
δ’ ὑπεράκρως, ζῆν προῃρημένον· ἀπὸ δὲ τῆς Σωκράτους ὁμιλίας πολλὰ
μὲν ἐπανορθωθέντα τοῦ βίου, τὰ δὲ λοιπὰ τῷ μεγέθει τῶν ἄλλων ἔργων
ἐπικρυψάμενον.
</p>
<p>
Of the three epithets, whereby the author describes the bad
tendencies of Alkibiadês, full illustrations will be seen in his
proceedings, hereafter to be described. The improving influence here
ascribed to Sokratês is unfortunately far less borne out.</p>

<p>
I do not know how far the memorable narrative ascribed to Alkibiadês
in the Symposium of Plato (c. 33, 34, pp. 216, 217) can be
regarded as matter of actual fact and history, so far as Sokratês
is concerned; but it is abundant proof in regard to the general
relations of Alkibiadês with others: compare Xenophon, Memorab. i, 2,
29, 30; iv. 1-2.
</p>
<p>
Several of the dialogues of Plato present to us striking pictures of
the palæstra, with the boys, the young men, the gymnastic teachers,
engaged in their exercises or resting from them, and the philosophers
and spectators who came there for amusement and conversation. See
particularly the opening chapters of the Lysis and the Charmidês;
also the Rivales, where the scene is laid in the house of a
γραμματιστὴς, or schoolmaster. In the Lysis, Sokratês professes to
set his own conversation with these interesting youths as an antidote
to the corrupting flatteries of most of those who sought to gain
their good-will. Οὕτω χρὴ, ὦ Ἱππόθαλες, τοῖς παιδικοῖς διαλέγεσθαι,
ταπεινοῦντα καὶ συστέλλοντα, ἀλλὰ μὴ, ὥσπερ σὺ, χαυνοῦντα καὶ
διαθρύπτοντα (Lysis, c. 7, p. 210).
</p>
<p>
See, in illustration of what is here said about Alkibiadês as a
youth, Euripid. Supplic. 906 (about Parthenopæus), and the beautiful
lines in the Atys of Catullus, 60-69.
</p>
<p>
There cannot be a doubt that the characters of all the Greek youth
of any pretensions were considerably affected by this society and
conversation of their boyish years; though the subject is one upon
which the full evidence cannot well be produced and discussed.</p>

<p>
Xenophon represents Alkibiadês and Kritias as frequenting the society
of Sokratês, for the same reason and with the same objects as Plato
affirms that young men generally went to the Sophists: see Plato,
Sophist. c. 20, p. 232 D.
</p>
<p>
“Nam et Socrati (observes Quintilian, Inst. Or. ii, 16) objiciunt
comici, docere cum, quomodo pejorem causam meliorem reddat; et contra
Tisiam et Gorgiam similia dicit polliceri Plato.”
</p>
<p>
The representation given by Plato of the great influence acquired by
Sokratês over Alkibiadês, and of the deference and submission of the
latter, is plainly not to be taken as historical, even if we had not
the more simple and trustworthy picture of Xenophon. Isokratês goes
so far as to say that Sokratês was never known by any one as teacher
of Alkibiadês: which is an exaggeration in the other direction.

compare also Plato, Meno. p. 91, and Gorgias, c. 4. p. 449 E.,
asserting the connection, in the mind of Gorgias, between teaching to
speak and teaching to think—λέγειν καὶ φρονεῖν, etc.
</p>
<p>
It would not be reasonable to repeat, as true and just, all the
polemical charges against those who are called Sophists, even as we
find them in Plato, without scrutiny and consideration. But modern
writers on Grecian affairs run down the Sophists even more than Plato
did, and take no notice of the admissions in their favor which he,
though their opponent, is perpetually making.
</p>
<p>
This is a very extensive subject, to which I hope to revert.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_59"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_59">[59]</a></span> I dissent entirely from the judgment of Dr. Thirlwall,
who repeats what is the usual representation of Sokratês and the
Sophists, depicting Alkibiadês as “ensnared by the Sophists,” while
Sokratês is described as a good genius preserving him from their
corruptions (Hist. of Greece, vol. iii, ch. xxiv, pp. 312, 313, 314).
I think him also mistaken when he distinguishes so pointedly Sokratês
from the Sophists; when he describes the Sophists as “pretenders
to wisdom;” as “a new school;” as “teaching that there was no real
difference between truth and falsehood, right and wrong,” etc.
</p>
<p>
All the plausibility that there is in this representation, arises
from a confusion between the original sense and the modern sense of
the word Sophist; the latter seemingly first bestowed upon the word
by Plato and Aristotle. In the common ancient acceptation of the
word at Athens, it meant not a <i>school</i> of persons professing common
doctrines, but a <i>class</i> of men bearing the same name, because they
derived their celebrity from analogous objects of study and common
intellectual occupation. The Sophists were men of similar calling
and pursuits, partly speculative, partly professional; but they
differed widely from each other, both in method and doctrine. (See
for example Isokratês, cont. Sophistas, Orat. xiii; Plato, Meno.
p. 87 B.) Whoever made himself eminent in speculative pursuits,
and communicated his opinions by public lecture, discussion, or
conversation, was called a Sophist, whatever might be the conclusions
which he sought to expound or defend. The difference between taking
money, and expounding gratuitously, on which Sokratês himself was so
fond of dwelling (Xenoph. Memor. i, 6, 12), has plainly no essential
bearing on the case. When Æschinês the orator reminds the dikasts,
“Recollect that you Athenians put to death <i>the Sophist Sokratês</i>,
because he was shown to have been the teacher of Kritias,” (Æschin.
cont. Timarch. c. 34, p. 74,) he uses the word in its natural and
true Athenian sense. He had no point to make against Sokratês, who
had then been dead more than forty years; but he describes him by his
profession or occupation, just as he would have said, <i>Hippokratês
the physician</i>, <i>Pheidias the sculptor</i>, etc. Dionysius of Halikarn.
calls both Plato and Isokratês sophists (Ars Rhetor. De Compos.
Verborum, p. 208 R.). The Nubes of Aristophanês, and the defences put
forth by Plato and Xenophon, show that Sokratês was not only called
by the name Sophist, but regarded just in the same light as that in
which Dr. Thirlwall presents to us what he calls “the new School
of the Sophists;” as “a corruptor of youth, indifferent to truth
or falsehood, right or wrong,” etc. See a striking passage in the
Politicus of Plato, c. 38, p. 299 B. Whoever thinks, as I think, that
these accusations were falsely advanced against Sokratês, will be
careful how he advances them against the general profession to which
Sokratês belonged.
</p>
<p>
That there were unprincipled and immoral men among the class of
Sophists—as there are and always have been among schoolmasters,
professors, lawyers, etc., and all bodies of men—I do not doubt; in
what proportion, we cannot determine. But the extreme hardship of
passing a sweeping condemnation on the great body of intellectual
teachers at Athens, and canonizing exclusively Sokratês and his
followers, will be felt, when we recollect that the well-known
Apologue, called the <i>Choice of Hercules</i>, was the work of the
Sophist Prodikus, and his favorite theme of lecture (Xenophon, Memor.
ii, 1, 21-34). To this day, that Apologue remains without a superior,
for the impressive simplicity with which it presents one of the
most important points of view of moral obligation: and it has been
embodied in a greater number of books of elementary morality than
anything of Sokratês, Plato, or Xenophon. To treat the author of that
Apologue, and the class to which he belonged, as teaching “that there
was no real difference between right and wrong, truth and falsehood,”
etc., is a criticism not in harmony with the just and liberal tone of
Dr. Thirlwall’s history.
</p>
<p>
I will add that Plato himself, in a very important passage of
the Republic (vi, c. 6, 7, pp. 492-493), refutes the imputation
against the Sophists of being specially the corruptors of youth.
He represents them as inculcating upon their youthful pupils that
morality which was received as true and just in their age and
society; nothing better, nothing worse. The grand corruptor, he
says, is society itself; the Sophists merely repeat the voice and
judgment of society. Without inquiring at present how far Plato or
Sokratês were right in condemning the received morality of their
countrymen, I most fully accept his assertion that the great body of
the contemporary professional teachers taught what was considered
good morality among the Athenian public: there were doubtless some
who taught a better morality, others who taught a worse. And this may
be said with equal truth of the great body of professional teachers
in every age and nation.
</p>
<p>
Xenophon enumerates various causes to which he ascribes the
corruption of the character of Alkibiadês; wealth, rank, personal
beauty, flatterers, etc.; but he does not name the Sophists among
them (Memorab. i, 2. 24, 25).</p>

Antisthenês, companion and pupil of Sokratês, and originator of
what is called the Cynic philosophy, contemporary and personally
acquainted with Alkibiadês, was full of admiration for his extreme
personal beauty, and pronounced him to be strong, manly, and
audacious, but unschooled, <em class="gesperrt">ἀπαίδευτον</em>. His scandals about the
lawless life of Alkibiadês, however, exceed what we can reasonably
admit, even from a contemporary (Antisthenês ap. Athenæum, v, p. 220,
xii, p. 534). Antisthenês had composed a dialogue called Alkibiadês
(Diog. Laërt. vi, 15).

The comic writers of the day—Eupolis, Aristophanês, Pherekratês, and

the excesses of Alkibiadês, real or supposed. There was a tale,
untrue, but current in comic tradition, that Alkibiadês, who was not
a man to suffer himself to be insulted with impunity, had drowned
Eupolis in the sea, in revenge, for his comedy of the Baptæ. See

</p>
<p>
I incline to suspect, from this passage, that the father of Endius
was not named Alkibiadês, but that Endius himself was nevertheless
named Ἔνδιος Ἀλκιβιάδου, in consequence of the peculiar intimacy of
connection with the Athenian family in which that name occurred. If
the father of Endius was really named Alkibiadês, Endius himself
would naturally, pursuant to general custom, be styled Ἔνδιος
Ἀλκιβιάδου: there would be nothing in this denomination to call for
the particular remark of Thucydidês. But according to the view of
the Scholiast and most commentators, all that Thucydidês wishes to
explain here is, how the father of Endius came to receive the name of
Alkibiadês. Now if he had meant this, he surely would not have used
the terms which we read: the circumstance to be explained would then
have reference to the father of Endius, not to Endius himself, nor to
the family generally. His words imply that the family, that is, each
successive individual of the family, derived his Laconian designation
(not from the name of his father, but) from his intimate connection
of hospitality with the Athenian family of Alkibiadês. Each
successive individual attached to his own personal name the genitive
case Ἀλκιβιάδου, instead of the genitive of his real father’s name.
Doubtless this was an anomaly in Grecian practice; but on the present
occasion, we are to expect something anomalous; had it not been such,
Thucydidês would not have stepped aside to particularize it.</p>

<p>
The full force of this grandiose display cannot be felt unless we
bring to our minds the special position both of Athens and the
Athenian allies towards Olympia,—and of Alkibiadês himself towards
Athens, Argos, and the rest of Greece,—in the first half of the year
420 <small>B.C.</small>
</p>
<p>
Alkibiadês obtained from Euripidês the honor of an epinikian ode,
or song of triumph, to celebrate this event; of which a few lines
are preserved by Plutarch (Alkib. c. 11). It is curious that the
poet alleges Alkibiadês to have been first, second, and <i>third</i>,
in the course; while Alkibiadês himself, more modest and doubtless
more exact, pretends only to first, second, and <i>fourth</i>. Euripidês
informs us that Alkibiadês was crowned twice and proclaimed twice—δὶς
στεφθέντ’ ἐλαίᾳ κάρυκι βοᾷν παραδοῦναι. Reiske, Coray, and Schäfer,
have thought it right to alter this word δὶς to τρὶς, without any
authority, which completely alters the asserted fact. Sintenis in his
edition of Plutarch has properly restored the word δὶς.
</p>
<p>
How long the recollection of this famous Olympic festival remained
in the Athenian public mind, is attested partly by the Oratio de
Bigis of Isokratês, composed in defence of the son of Alkibiadês at
least twenty-five years afterwards, perhaps more. Isokratês repeats
the loose assertion of Euripidês, πρῶτος, δεύτερος, and τρίτος (Or.
xvi, p. 353, sect. 40). The spurious Oration called that of Andokidês
against Alkibiadês also preserves many of the current tales, some of
which I have admitted into the text, because I think them probable
in themselves, and because that oration itself may reasonably be
believed to be a composition of the middle of the fourth century
B.C. That oration puts all the proceedings of Alkibiadês in a
very invidious temper and with palpable exaggeration. The story
of Alkibiadês having robbed an Athenian named Diomêdês of a fine
chariot, appears to be a sort of variation on the story about Tisias,
which figures in the oration of Isokratês; see Andokid. cont. Alkib.
sect. 26: possibly Alkibiadês may have left one of the teams not paid
for. The aid lent to Alkibiadês by the Chians, Ephesians, etc., as
described in that oration, is likely to be substantially true, and
may easily be explained. Compare Athenæ. i, p. 3.
</p>
<p>
Our information about the arrangements of the chariot-racing at
Olympia is very imperfect. We do not distinctly know how the seven
chariots of Alkibiadês ran,—in how many races,—for all the seven
could not, in my judgment, have run in one and the same race. There
must have been many other chariots to run, belonging to other
competitors: and it seems difficult to believe that ever a greater
number than ten can have run in the same race, since the course
involved going <i>twelve</i> times round the goal (Pindar, Ol. iii,
33; vi, 75). Ten competing chariots run in the race described by
Sophoklês (Electr. 708), and if we could venture to construe strictly
the expression of the poet,—<em class="gesperrt">δέκατον ἐκπληρῶν</em> ὄχον,—it would
seem that ten was the extreme number permitted to run. Even so great
a number as ten was replete with danger to the persons engaged,
as may be seen by reading the description in Sophoklês (compare
Demosth. Ἐρωτ. Λογ. p. 1410), who refers indeed to a Pythian and
not an Olympic solemnity: but the main circumstances must have been
common to both; and we know that the twelve turns (δωδεκάγναμπτον
δωδεκάδρομον) <i>were</i> common to both (Pindar, Pyth. v, 31).
</p>
<p>
Alkibiadês was not the only person who gained a chariot victory at
this 90th Olympiad, 420 <small>B.C.</small> Lichas the Lacedæmonian also
gained one (Thucyd. v, 50), though the chariot was obliged to be
entered in another name, since the Lacedæmonians were interdicted
from attendance.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Thirlwall (Hist. of Greece, vol. iii, ch. xxiv, p. 316) says: “We
are not aware that the Olympiad, in which these chariot-victories of
Alkibiadês were gained, can be distinctly fixed. But it was probably
Olymp. 89, <small>B.C.</small> 424.”
</p>
<p>
In my judgment, both Olymp. 88 (<small>B.C.</small> 428) and Olymp. 89
(<small>B.C.</small> 424) are excluded from the possible supposition, by
the fact that the general war was raging at both periods. To suppose
that in the midst of the summer of these two fighting years, there
was an Olympic truce for a month, allowing Athens and her allies to
send thither their solemn legations, their chariots for competition,
and their numerous individual visitors, appears to me contrary to
all probability. The Olympic month of <small>B.C.</small> 424, would occur
just about the time when Brasidas was at the Isthmus levying troops
for his intended expedition to Thrace, and when he rescued Megara
from the Athenian attack. This would not be a very quiet time for
the peaceable Athenian visitors, with the costly display of gold and
silver plate and the ostentatious theôry, to pass by, on its way to
Olympia. During the time when the Spartans occupied Dekeleia, the
solemn processions of communicants at the Eleusinian mysteries could
never march along the Sacred Way from Athens to Eleusis. Xen. Hell.
i, 4, 20.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, we see that the very first article both of the Truce for
one year and of the Peace of Nikias, expressly stipulate for liberty
to all to attend the common temples and festivals. The first of the
two relates to Delphi expressly: the second is general, and embraces
Olympia as well as Delphi. If the Athenians had visited Olympia in
428 or 424 <small>B.C.</small> without impediment, these stipulations in
the treaties would have no purpose nor meaning. But the fact of their
standing in the front of the treaty, proves that they were looked
upon as of much interest and importance.
</p>
<p>
I have placed the Olympic festival wherein Alkibiadês contended
with his seven chariots, in 420 <small>B.C.</small>, in the peace, but
immediately after the war. No other festival appears to me at all
suitable.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Thirlwall farther assumes, as a matter of course, that there was
only <i>one</i> chariot-race at this Olympic festival, that all the seven
chariots of Alkibiadês ran in this one race, and that in the festival
of 420 <small>B.C.</small>, Lichas gained <i>the</i> prize: thus implying that
Alkibiadês could not have gained the prize at the same festival.
</p>
<p>
I am not aware that there is any evidence to prove either of these
three propositions. To me they all appear improbable and unfounded.
</p>
<p>
We know from Pausanias (vi, 13, 2) that even in the case of the
stadiodromi, or runners who contended in the stadium, all were not
brought out in one race. They were distributed into sets, or batches,
of what number we know not. Each set ran its own heat, and the
victors in each then competed with each other in a fresh heat; so
that the victor who gained the grand final prize was sure to have won
two heats.
</p>
<p>
Now if this practice was adopted with the foot-runners, much
more would it be likely to be adopted with the chariot-racers in
case many chariots were brought to the same festival. The danger
would be lessened, the sport would be increased, and the glory
of the competitors enhanced. The Olympic festival lasted five
days, a long time to provide amusement for so vast a crowd of
spectators. Alkibiadês and Lichas may therefore both have gained
chariot-victories at the same festival: of course only one of them
can have gained the grand final prize, and which of the two that was
it is impossible to say.</p>

We see by comparison with this incident how much less rough and harsh
was the manner of dealing at Athens, and in how much more serious a
light blows to the person were considered. At the Athenian festival
of the Dionysia, if a person committed disorder or obtruded himself
into a place not properly belonging to him in the theatre, the archon
or his officials were both empowered and required to repress the
disorder by turning the person out, and fining him, if necessary.
But they were upon no account to strike him. If they did, they were
punishable themselves by the dikastery afterwards (Demosth. cont.
Meidiam, c. 49).</p>

καὶ ἐς μεθορίαν τῆς Ἐπιδαυρίας ἐλθόντες ἡσύχαζον.
</p>
<p>
In explaining this passage, I venture to depart from the views of all
the commentators; with the less scruple, as it seems to me that even
the best of them are here embarrassed and unsatisfactory.
</p>
<p>
The meaning which I give to the words is the most strict and
literal possible: “The Argeians, having set out on the 26th of
the month before Karneius, and <i>keeping that day during the whole
time</i>, invaded the Epidaurian territory, and went on ravaging it.”
By “during the whole time” is meant, during the whole time that
this expedition lasted. That is, in my judgment, they kept the
twenty-sixth day of the antecedent month for a whole fortnight or so;
they called each successive day by the same name; they stopped the
computed march of time; the twenty-seventh was never admitted to have
arrived. Dr. Thirlwall translates it (Hist. Gr. vol. iii, ch. xxiv,
p. 331): “They began their march on a day which they had <i>always</i>
been used to keep holy.” But surely the words πάντα τὸν χρόνον must
denote some definite interval of time, and can hardly be construed
as equivalent to ἀεί. Moreover the words, as Dr. Thirlwall construes
them, introduce a new fact which has no visible bearing on the main
affirmation of the sentence.
</p>
<p>
The meaning which I give may perhaps be called in question on
the ground that such tampering with the calendar is too absurd
and childish to have been really committed. Yet it is not more
absurd than the two votes of the Athenian assembly (in 290
<small>B.C.</small>), who being in the month of Munychion, first
passed a vote that that month should be the month Anthestêrion; next,
that it should be the month Boêdromion; in order that Demetrius
Poliorkêtês might be initiated both in the lesser and greater
mysteries of Dêmêtêr, both at once and at the same time. Demetrius
arrived at Athens in the month Munychion, and went through both
ceremonies with little or no delay; the religious scruple, and the
dignity of the Two Goddesses being saved by altering the name of the
month twice (Plutarch, Demetrius, c. 26).
</p>
<p>
Besides, if we look to the conduct of the Argeians themselves at
a subsequent period (<small>B.C.</small> 389, Xenophon, Hellen. iv, 7,
2, 5; v, 1, 29), we shall see them playing an analogous trick with
the calendar in order to get the benefit of the sacred truce. When
the Lacedæmonians invaded Argos, the Argeians despatched heralds
with wreaths and the appropriate insignia, to warn them off on the
ground of its being the period of the holy truce,—though it <i>really
was not so</i>,—<em class="gesperrt">οὐχ ὅποτε κάθηκοι ὁ χρόνος, ἀλλ’ ὅποτε ἐμβάλλειν
μέλλοιεν Λακεδαιμόνιοι, τότε ὑπέφερον τοὺς μῆνας</em>—Οἱ δ’ Ἀργεῖοι
ἐπεὶ ἔγνωσαν οὐ δυνησόμενοι κωλύειν, ἔπεμψαν, ὥσπερ εἰώθεσαν,
ἐστεφανωμένους δύο κήρυκας <em class="gesperrt">ὑποφέροντας σπονδάς</em>. On more than
one occasion, this stratagem was successful: the Lacedæmonians did
not dare to act in defiance of the summons of the heralds, who
affirmed that it <i>was</i> the time of the truce, though in reality it
was not so. At last, the Spartan king Agesipolis actually went both
to Olympia and Delphi, to put the express question to those oracles,
whether he was bound to accept the truce at any moment, right or
wrong, when it might suit the convenience of the Argeians to bring it
forward as a sham plea (ὑποφέρειν). The oracles both told him that he
was under no obligation to submit to such a pretence; accordingly,
he sent back the heralds, refusing to attend to their summons, and
invaded the Argeian territory.
</p>
<p>
Now here is a case exactly in point, with this difference; that the
Argeians, when they are invaders of Epidaurus, falsify the calendar
in order to blot out the holy truce where it really ought to have
come: whereas when they are the party invaded, they commit similar
falsification in order to introduce the truce where it does not
legitimately belong. I conceive, therefore, that such an analogous
incident completely justifies the interpretation which I have given
of the passage now before us in Thucydidês.
</p>
<p>
But even if I were unable to produce a case so exactly parallel, I
should still defend the interpretation. Looking to the state of the
ancient Grecian calendars, the proceeding imputed to the Argeians
ought not to be looked on as too preposterous and absurd for
adoption, with the same eyes as we should regard it now.
</p>
<p>
With the exception of Athens, we do not know completely the calendar
of a single other Grecian city: but we know that the months of
all were lunar months, and that the practice followed in regard
to intercalation, for the prevention of inconvenient divergence
between lunar and solar time, was different in each different
city. Accordingly, the lunar month of one city did not, except by
accident, either begin or end at the same time as the lunar month of
another. M. Boeckh observes (ad Corp. Inscr. t. i, p. 734): “Variorum
populorum menses, qui sibi secundum legitimos annorum cardines
respondent, non quovis conveniunt anno, nisi cyclus intercalationum
utrique populi idem sit: sed ubi differunt cycli, altero populo
prius intercalante mensem dum non intercalat alter, eorum qui non
intercalarunt mensis certus cedit jam in eum mensem alterorum qui
præcedit illum cui vulgo respondet certus iste mensis: quod tamen
negligere solent chronologi.” Compare also the valuable Dissertation
of K. F. Hermann, Ueber die Griechische Monatskunde, Götting. 1844,
pp. 21-27, where all that is known about the Grecian names and
arrangement of months is well brought together.
</p>
<p>
The names of the Argeian months we hardly know at all (see K. F.
Hermann, pp. 84-124): indeed, the only single name resting on
positive proof, is that of a month <i>Hermæus</i>. How far the months of
Argos agreed with those of Epidaurus or Sparta we do not know, nor
have we any right to presume that they did agree. Nor is it by any
means clear that every city in Greece had what may properly be called
a <i>system</i> of intercalation, so correct as to keep the calendar
right without frequent arbitrary interferences. Even at Athens, it
is not yet satisfactorily proved that the Metonic calendar was ever
actually received into civil use. Cicero, in describing the practice
of the Sicilian Greeks about reckoning of time, characterizes
their interferences for the purpose of correcting the calendar as
occasional rather than systematic. Verres took occasion from these
interferences to make a still more violent change, by declaring the
Ides of January to be the calends of March (Cicero, Verr. ii, 52,
129).
</p>
<p>
Now where a people are accustomed to get wrong in their calendar, and
to see occasional interferences introduced by authority to set them
right, the step which I here suppose the Argeians to have taken about
the invasion of Epidaurus will not appear absurd and preposterous.
The Argeians would pretend that the real time for celebrating the
festival of Karneia had not yet arrived. On that point, they were not
bound to follow the views of other Dorian states, since there does
not seem to have been any recognized authority for proclaiming the
commencement of the Karneian truce, as the Eleians proclaimed the
Olympic and the Corinthians the Isthmiac truce. In saying, therefore,
that the twenty-sixth of the month preceding Karneius should be
repeated, and that the twenty-seventh should not be recognized as
arriving for a fortnight or three weeks, the Argeian government would
only be employing an expedient the like of which had been before
resorted to; though, in the case before us, it was employed for a
fraudulent purpose.
</p>
<p>
The Spartan month <i>Hekatombeus</i> appears to have corresponded with the
Attic month Hekatombæon; the Spartan month following it, <i>Karneius</i>,
with the Attic month Metageitnion (Hermann, p. 112), our months
July and August; such correspondence being by no means exact or
constant. Both Dr. Arnold and Göller speak of Hekatombeus as if it
were the <i>Argeian</i> month preceding Karneius: but we only know it
as a <i>Spartan</i> month. Its name does not appear among the months of
the Dorian cities in Sicily, among whom nevertheless Karneius seems
universal. See Franz, Comm. ad Corp. Inscript. Græc. No. 5475, 5491,
5640. Part xxxii, p. 640.
</p>
<p>
The tricks played with the calendar at Rome, by political authorities
for party purposes, are well known to every one. And even in some
states of Greece, the course of the calendar was so uncertain as to
serve as a proverbial expression for inextricable confusion. See
Hesychius—<em class="gesperrt">Ἐν Κέῳ τις ἡμέρα</em>; Ἐπὶ τῶν οὐκ
εὐγνώστον· οὐδεὶς γὰρ οἶδεν ἐν Κέῳ τις ἡ ἡμέρα, ὅτι οὐκ ἑστᾶσιν αἱ
ἡμέραι, ἀλλ’ ὡς ἕκαστοι θέλουσιν ἄγουσι. See also Aristoph. Nubes,
605.

If we do not adopt this reading, we must construe ἐξεστρατεῦσθαι,

produced for putting such a meaning upon the verb ἐκστρατεύω: and
the view of Dr. Arnold, who conceives that this meaning exclusively
belongs to the preterite or pluperfect tense, is powerfully
contradicted by the use of the word ἐξεστρατευμένων (ii, 7), the same
verb and the same tense, yet in a meaning contrary to that which he
assigns.

It appears to me the least objectionable proceeding of the two, to

<p id="Footnote_119"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_119">[119]</a></span> Very little can be made out respecting the structure
of the Lacedæmonian army. We know that the enômoty was the elementary
division, the military unit: that the pentekosty was composed of a
definite (not always the same) number of enômoties: that the lochus
also was composed of a definite (not always the same) number of
pentekosties. The mora appears to have been a still larger division,
consisting of so many lochi (according to Xenophon, of four lochi):
but Thucydidês speaks as if he knew no division larger than the
lochus.
</p>
<p>
Beyond this very slender information, there seems no other fact
certainly established about the Lacedæmonian military distribution.
Nor ought we reasonably to expect to find that these words <i>enômoty</i>,
<i>pentekosty</i>, lochus, etc., indicate any fixed number of men: our own
names <i>regiment</i>, <i>company</i>, <i>troop</i>, <i>brigade</i>, <i>division</i>, etc.,
are all more or less indefinite as to positive numbers and proportion
to each other.
</p>
<p>
That which was peculiar to the Lacedæmonian drill, was, the teaching
a small number of men like an enômoty (twenty-five, thirty-two,
thirty-six men, as we sometimes find it), to perform its evolutions
under the command of its enômotarch. When this was once secured, it
is probable that the combination of these elementary divisions was
left to be determined in every case by circumstances.
</p>
<p>
Thucydidês states two distinct facts. 1. Each enômoty had <i>four
men in front</i>. 2. Each enômoty <i>varied in depth</i>, according as
every lochagus chose. Now Dobree asks, with much reason, how these
two assertions are to be reconciled? Given the number of men in
front, the depth of the enômoty is of course determined, without
any reference to the discretion of any one. These two assertions
appear distinctly contradictory; unless we suppose (what seems very
difficult to believe) that the lochage might make one or two of the
four files of the same enômoty deeper than the rest. Dobree proposes,
as a means of removing this difficulty, to expunge some words from
the text. One cannot have confidence, however, in the conjecture.</p>

The strong and precise language, which Thucydidês here uses, shows
that this was a privilege pointedly noted and much esteemed: among
the Lacedæmonians, especially, ancient routine was more valued than
elsewhere. And it is essential to take notice of the circumstance, in
order to appreciate the generalship of Agis, which has been rather
hardly criticized.</p>

</p>
<p>
The last words of this sentence present a difficulty which has
perplexed all the commentators, and which none of them have yet
satisfactorily cleared up.
</p>
<p>
They all admit that the expressions, <em class="gesperrt">τοῦ, τοῦ μὴ</em>, preceding
the infinitive mood as here, signify <i>design</i> or <i>purpose</i>; ἕνεκα
being understood. But none of them can construe the sentence
satisfactorily with this meaning: accordingly they here ascribe to
the words a different and exceptional meaning. See the notes of
Poppo, Göller, and Dr. Arnold, in which notes the views of other
critics are cited and discussed.
</p>
<p>
Some say that τοῦ μὴ in this place means the same as ὥστε μή: others
affirm, that it is identical with διὰ τὸ μὴ or with τῷ μή. “Formula
<em class="gesperrt">τοῦ, τοῦ μὴ</em> (say Bauer and Göller), plerumque <i>consilium</i>
significat: interdum <i>effectum</i> (<i>i. e.</i> ὥστε μή); hic <i>causam</i>
indicat (i. e. διὰ τὸ μὴ, or τῷ μή).” But I agree with Dr. Arnold
in thinking that the last of these three alleged meanings is wholly
unauthorized; while the second, which is adopted by Dr. Arnold
himself, is sustained only by feeble and dubious evidence; for the
passage of Thucydidês (ii, 4. τοῦ μὴ ἐκφεύγειν) may be as well
construed, as Poppo’s note thereupon suggests, without any such
supposed exceptional sense of the words.
</p>
<p>
Now it seems to me quite possible to construe the words τοῦ μὴ φθῆναι
here in their regular and legitimate sense of <em class="gesperrt">ἕνεκα τοῦ</em>, or
<i>consilium</i>. But first an error must be cleared up which pervades the
view of most of the commentators. They suppose that those Argeians,
who are here affirmed to have been “<i>trodden under foot</i>,” were so
trodden down by <i>the Lacedæmonians</i> in their advance. But this is in
every way improbable. The Lacedæmonians were particularly slow in
their motions, regular in their ranks, and backward as to pursuit,
qualities which are dwelt upon by Thucydidês in regard to this very
battle. They were not at all likely to overtake such terrified men as
were only anxious to run away: moreover, if they did overtake them,
they would spear them, not trample them under foot.
</p>
<p>
To be trampled under foot, though possible enough from the numerous
Persian cavalry (Herodot. vii, 173; Xenoph. Hellen. iii, 4, 12), is
not the treatment which defeated soldiers meet with from victorious
hostile infantry in the field, especially Lacedæmonian infantry. But
it is precisely the treatment which they meet with, if they be in one
of the hinder ranks, from their own panic-stricken comrades in the
front rank, who find the enemy closing upon them, and rush back madly
to get away from him. Of course it was the Argeians in the front rank
who were seized with the most violent panic, and who thus fell back
upon their own comrades in the rear ranks, overthrowing and treading
them down to secure their own escape. It seems quite plain that it
was the Argeians in front—not the Lacedæmonians—who trod down their
comrades in the rear (there were probably six or eight men in every
file), in order to escape themselves before the Lacedæmonians should
be upon them: compare Xen. Hellenic. iv, 4, 11; Œconomic. viii, 5.
</p>
<p>
There are therefore in the whole scene which Thucydidês describes,
three distinct subjects: 1. The Lacedæmonians 2. The Argeians
soldiers, who were trodden down. 3. Other Argeian soldiers, who trod
them down in order to get away themselves. Out of these three he
only specifies the first two; but the third is present to his mind,
and is implied in his narrative, just as much as if he had written
καταπατηθέντας <em class="gesperrt">ὑπ’ ἄλλων</em>, or ὑπ’ ἀλλήλων, as in Xenoph.
Hellen. iv. 4, 11.
</p>
<p>
Now it is to this third subject, implied in the narrative, but not
formally specified (<i>i. e.</i> those Argeians who trod down their
comrades in order to get away themselves), or rather to the second
and third conjointly and confusedly, that the <i>design</i> or <i>purpose</i>
(<i>consilium</i>) in the words τοῦ μὴ φθῆναι refers.
</p>
<p>
Farther, the commentators all construe τοῦ μὴ φθῆναι τὴν ἐγκατάληψιν,
as if the last word were an accusative case coming <i>after</i> φθῆναι
and governed by it. But there is also another construction, equally
good Greek, and much better for the sense. In my judgment, τὴν
ἐγκατάληψιν is here the accusative case coming <i>before</i> φθῆναι and
forming the <i>subject</i> of it. The words will thus read (ἕνεκα) τοῦ τὴν
ἐγκατάληψιν μὴ φθῆναι (ἐπελθοῦσαν αὐτοῖς): “in order that the actual
grasp of the Lacedæmonians might not be beforehand in coming upon
them;” “might not come upon them too soon,” <i>i. e.</i> “sooner than they
could get away.” And since the word ἐγκατάληψις is an abstract active
substantive, so, in order to get at the real meaning here, we may
substitute the concrete words with which it correlates, <i>i. e.</i> τοὺς
Λακεδαιμονίους ἐγκαταλαβόντας, subject as well as attribute, for the
active participle is here essentially involved.
</p>
<p>
The sentence would then read, supposing the ellipsis filled up and
the meaning expressed in full and concrete words—ἔστιν οὓς καὶ
καταπατηθέντας ὑπ’ ἀλλήλων φευγόντων (or βιαζομένων), ἕνεκα τοῦ τοὺς
Λακεδαιμονίους μὴ φθῆναι ἐγκαταλαβόντας αὐτοὺς (τοὺς φεύγοντας): “As
soon as the Lacedæmonians approached near, the Argeians gave way at
once, without staying for hand-combat: and some were even trodden
down by each other, or by their own comrades running away in order
that the Lacedæmonians might not be beforehand in catching them
sooner than they could escape.”
</p>
<p>
Construing in this way the sentence as it now stands, we have τοῦ
μὴ φθῆναι used in its regular and legitimate sense of <i>purpose</i>, or
<i>consilium</i>. We have moreover a plain and natural state of facts, in
full keeping with the general narrative. Nor is there any violence
put upon the words. Nothing more is done than to expand a very
elliptical sentence, and to fill up that entire sentence which was
present to the writer’s own mind. To do this properly is the chief
duty, as well as the chief difficulty, of an expositor of Thucydidês.</p>

corrupt, in regard to several words of this clause; though the
general sense appears sufficiently certain, that the Epidaurians
are to be allowed to clear themselves in respect to this demand by
an oath. In regard to this purifying oath, it seems to have been
essential that the oath should be <i>tendered</i> by one litigant party
and <i>taken</i> by the other: perhaps therefore σέμεν or θέμεν λῇν
(Valckenaer’s conjecture) might be preferable to εἶμεν λῇν.
</p>
<p>
To Herodot. vi, 86, and Aristotel. Rhetoric. i, 16, 6, which Dr.
Arnold and other commentators notice in illustration of this
practice, we may add the instructive exposition of the analogous
practice in the procedure of Roman law, as given by Von Savigny,
in his System des heutigen Römischen Rechts, sects. 309-313, vol.
vii, pp. 53-83. It was an oath tendered by one litigant party to
the opposite, in hopes that the latter would refuse to take it; if
taken, it had the effect of a judgment in favor of the swearer. But
the Roman lawyers laid down many limits and formalities, with respect
to this <i>jusjurandum delatum</i>, which Von Savigny sets forth with his
usual perspicuity.</p>

</p>
<p>
One cannot be certain about the meaning of these two last words, but
I incline to believe that they express a peremptory and almost a
hostile sentiment, such as I have given in the text. The allies here
alluded to are Athens, Elis, and Mantineia; all hostile in feeling
to Sparta. The Lacedæmonians could not well decline admitting these
cities to share in this treaty as it stood; but would probably think
it suitable to repel them even with rudeness, if they desired any
change.
</p>
<p>
I rather imagine, too, that this last clause (ἐπιδείξαντας) has
reference exclusively to the Argeians, and not to the Lacedæmonians
also. The form of the treaty is, that of a resolution already taken
at Sparta, and sent for approval to Argos.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_135"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_135">[135]</a></span> Thucyd. v, 79. Αἰ δέ τινι τᾶν πολίων ᾖ ἀμφίλογα, ἢ τᾶν
ἐντὸς ἢ τᾶν ἐκτὸς Πελοποννάσου, αἴτε περὶ ὅρων αἴτε περὶ ἄλλου τινὸς,
διακριθῆμεν.
</p>
<p>
The object of this clause I presume to be, to provide that the joint
forces of Lacedæmon and Argos should not be bound to interfere
for every separate dispute of each single ally with a foreign
state, not included in the alliance. Thus, there were at this time
standing disputes between Bœotia and Athens, and between Megara and
Athens: the Argeians probably would not choose to pledge themselves
to interfere for the maintenance of the alleged rights of Bœotia
and Megara in these disputes. They guard themselves against such
necessity in this clause.
</p>
<p>
M. H. Meier, in his recent Dissertation (Die Privat. Schiedsrichter
und die öffentlichen Diäteten Athens (Halle, 1846), sect. 19, p. 41),
has given an analysis and explanation of this treaty which seems to
me on many points unsatisfactory.</p>

by this treaty to be (if we employ the language employed with

αὐτονόμους, αὐτοτελεῖς, αὐτοδίκους, Thucyd. v, 19. The last clause of
this treaty guarantees αὐτοδικíαν to all, though in language somewhat
different, τοῖς δὲ ἔταις κατὰ πάτρια δικάζεσθαι. The expression in
this treaty αὐτοπόλιες is substantially equivalent to αὐτοτελεῖς in
the former.
</p>
<p>
It is remarkable that we never find in Thucydidês the very convenient
Herodotean word δωσίδικοι (Herodot. vi, 42), though there are
occasions in these fourth and fifth books on which it would be useful
to his meaning.</p>

is indeed partially true: the alliance with Argos was one of the
causes of the resumption of war, but only one among others, some of
them more powerful. Thucydidês tells us that the <i>persuasions</i> of
Argos, to induce Athens to throw up her alliance with Sparta were
repeated and unavailing.</p>

envoy, I call attention to the attack and bombardment of Copenhagen
by the English government in 1807, together with the language used by
the English envoy to the Danish Prince Regent on the subject. We read
as follows in M. Thiers’s Histoire du Consulat et de l’Empire:—
</p>
<p>
“L’agent choisi étoit digne de sa mission. C’étoit M. Jackson qui
avait été autrefois chargé d’affaires en France, avant l’arrivée de
Lord Whitworth, à Paris, mais qu’on n’avoit pas pû y laisser, à cause
du mauvais esprit qu’il manifestoit en toute occasion. Introduit
auprès du régent, il allégua de prétendues stipulations secrètes, en
vertu desquelles le Danemark devoit, (disoit on) de gré ou de force,
faire partie d’une coalition contre l’Angleterre: il donna comme
raison d’agir la necessité où se trouvoit le cabinet Britannique de
prendre des précautions pour que les forces navales du Danemark et
le passage du Sund ne tombassent pas au pouvoir des François: et en
conséquence il demanda au nom de son gouvernement, qu’on livrât à
l’armée Angloise la forteresse de Kronenberg qui commande de Sund, le
port de Copenhague, et enfin la flotte elle-même—promettant de garder
le tout en dépôt, pour le compte du Danemark, qui seroit remis en
possession de ce qu’on alloit lui enlever, dès que le danger seroit
passé. M. Jackson assura que le Danemark ne perdroit rien, que l’on
se conduiroit chez lui en auxiliaires et en amis—que les troupes
Britanniques payeroient tout ce qu’elles consommeroient.—Et avec
quoi, répondit le prince indigné, payeriez vous notre honneur perdu,
si nous adhérions à cette infame proposition?—Le prince continuant,
et opposant à cette perfide intention la conduite loyale du Danemark,
qui n’avoit pris aucune précaution contre les Anglois, qui les
avoit toutes prises contre les François, ce dont on abusoit pour le
surprendre—<i>M. Jackson répondit à cette juste indignation par une
insolente familiarité, disant que la guerre étoit la guerre, qu’il
falloit se résigner à ces nécessités, et céder au plus fort quand
on étoit le plus foible</i>. Le prince congédia l’agent Anglois avec
des paroles fort dures, et lui déclara qu’il alloit se transporter
à Copenhague, pour y remplir ses devoirs de prince et de citoyen
Danois.” (Thiers, Histoire du Consulat et de l’Empire, tome viii,

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_169"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_169">[169]</a></span> Mr. Mitford, in the spirit which is usual with him,
while enlarging upon the suffering occasioned by this extensive
revolution both of inhabitants and of property throughout Sicily,
takes no notice of the cause in which it originated, namely, the
number of foreign mercenaries whom the Gelonian dynasty had brought
in and enrolled as new citizens (Gelon alone having brought in ten
thousand, Diodor. xi, 72), and the number of exiles whom they had
banished and dispossessed.
</p>
<p>
I will here notice only one of his misrepresentations respecting the
events of this period, because it is definite as well as important
(vol. iv, p. 9, chap. xviii, sect. 1).
</p>
<p>
“But thus (he says) in every little state, lands were left to
become public property, or to be assigned to new individual owners.
<i>Everywhere, then, that favorite measure of democracy, the equal
division of the lands of the state, was resolved upon</i>: a measure
impossible to be perfectly executed; impossible to be maintained as
executed; and of very doubtful advantage, if it could be perfectly
executed and perfectly maintained.”
</p>
<p>
Again, sect. iii, p. 23, he speaks of “that incomplete and iniquitous
partition of lands,” etc.
</p>
<p>
Now, upon this we may remark:—
</p>
<p>
1. The <i>equal division of the lands</i> of the state, here affirmed by
Mr. Mitford, is a pure fancy of his own. He has no authority for it
whatever. Diodorus says (xi, 76) κατεκληρούχησαν τὴν χώραν, etc.; and
again (xi, 86) he speaks of τὸν ἀναδασμὸν τῆς χώρας: the <i>redivision</i>
of the territory; but respecting <i>equality of division</i>, not one
word does he say. Nor can any principle of division in this case be
less probable than equality; for one of the great motives of the
redivision was to provide for those exiles who had been dispossessed
by the Gelonian dynasty: and these men would receive lots, greater or
less, on the ground of compensation for loss, greater or less as it
might have been. Besides, immediately after the redivision, we find
rich and poor mentioned, just as before (xi, 86).
</p>
<p>
2. Next, Mr. Mitford calls “the equal division of all the lands
of the state” the <i>favorite measure of democracy</i>. This is an
assertion not less incorrect. Not a single democracy in Greece, so
far as my knowledge extends, can be produced, in which such equal
partition is ever known to have been carried into effect. In the
Athenian democracy, especially, not only there existed constantly
great inequality of landed property, but the oath annually taken
by the popular heliastic judges had a special clause, protesting
emphatically against <i>redivision of the land or extinction of
debts</i>.</p>

<p id="Footnote_177"><span class="label"><a

the return of Duketius to Sicily: “The Syracusan chiefs brought
back Duketius from Corinth, apparently to make him instrumental to
their own views for advancing the power of their commonwealth. They
permitted, or rather encouraged him to establish a colony of mixed
people, Greeks and Sicels, at Calé Acté, on the northern coast of the
island,” (ch. xviii, sect. i, vol. iv, p. 13.)</p>

<p>The statement that “the Syracusans brought back Duketius, or
encouraged him to come back, or to found the colony of Kalê Aktê,”
is a complete departure from Diodorus on the part of Mr. Mitford;
who transforms a breach of parole on the part of the Sikel <i>prince</i>
into an ambitious manœuvre on the part of Syracusan <i>democracy</i>.
The words of Diodorus, the only authority in the case, are as
follows (xii, 8): Οὗτος δὲ (Duketius) ὀλίγον χρόνον μείνας ἐν
τῇ Κορίνθῳ, <em class="gesperrt">τὰς ὁμολογίας ἔλυσε</em>, καὶ
προσποιησάμενος χρησμὸν ὑπὸ τῶν θεῶν ἑαυτῷ δεδόσθαι, κτίσαι τὴν Καλὴν

Diodorus has greatly overrated its magnitude and importance.
</p>
<p>
Nor can it be true, as Diodorus affirms, that Trinakia was <i>the only</i>
Sikel township remaining unsubdued by the Syracusans, and that, after
conquering that place, they had subdued them all. We know that there
were no inconsiderable number of independent Sikels, at the time of

<p id="Footnote_186"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_186">[186]</a></span> The inscription in Boeckh’s Corpus Inscriptt. (No.
74, part i, p. 112) relating to the alliance between Athens and
Rhegium, conveys little certain information. Boeckh refers it to a
covenant concluded in the archonship of Apseudês at Athens (Olymp.
86, 4, <small>B.C.</small> 433-432, the year before the Peloponnesian war),
renewing an alliance which was even then of old date. But it appears
to me that the supposition of a renewal is only his own conjecture;
and even the name of the archon, <i>Apseudês</i>, which he has restored by
a plausible conjecture, can hardly be considered as certain.
</p>
<p>
If we could believe the story in Justin iv, 3, Rhegium must have
ceased to be Ionic before the Peloponnesian war. He states, that in
a sedition at Rhegium, one of the parties called in auxiliaries from
Himera. These Himeræan exiles having first destroyed the enemies
against whom they were invoked, next massacred the friends who had
invoked them: “ausi facinus nulli tyranno comparandum.” They married
the Rhegine women, and seized the city for themselves.
</p>
<p>
I do not know what to make of this story, which neither appears
noticed in Thucydidês, nor seems to consist with what he does tell
us.</p>

ἀριθμὸν πεντακοσίων νεῶν ἐσόμενον, etc.
</p>
<p>
Respecting the construction of this perplexing passage, read the
notes of Dr. Arnold, Poppo, and Göller: compare Poppo, ad Thucyd.
vol. i, ch. xv, p. 181.
</p>
<p>
I agree with Dr. Arnold and Göller in rejecting the construction of
αὐτοῦ with ἐξ Ἰταλίας καὶ Σικελίας, in the sense of “those ships
which were in Peloponnesus from Italy and Sicily.” This would be
untrue in point of fact, as they observe: there were no Sicilian
ships of war in Peloponnesus.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless I think, differing from them, that αὐτοῦ is not a
pronoun referring to ἐξ Ἰταλίας καὶ Σικελίας, but is used in contrast
with those words, and really means, “in or about Peloponnesus.” It
was contemplated that new ships should be built in Sicily and Italy,
of sufficient number to make the total fleet of the Lacedæmonian
confederacy, including the triremes already in Peloponnesus, equal to
five hundred sail. But it was never contemplated that the triremes in
Italy and Sicily <i>alone</i> should amount to five hundred sail, as Dr.
Arnold, in my judgment, erroneously imagines. Five hundred sail for
the entire confederacy would be a prodigious total: five hundred sail
for Sicily and Italy alone, would be incredible.
</p>
<p>
To construe the sentence as it stands now, putting aside the
conjecture of νῆες instead of ναῦς, or ἐπετάχθη instead of
ἐπετάχθησαν, which would make it run smoothly, we must admit the
supposition of a break or double construction, such as sometimes
occurs in Thucydidês. The sentence begins with one form of
construction and concludes with another. We must suppose, with
Göller, that αἱ πόλεις understood as the nominative case to
ἐπετάχθησαν. The dative cases (Λακεδαιμονίοις—ἑλομένοις) are to be
considered, I apprehend, as governed by νῆες ἐπετάχθησαν: that is,
these dative cases belong to the first form of construction, which
Thucydidês has not carried out. The sentence is begun as if νῆες
ἐπετάχθησαν were intended to follow.</p>

Diodorus probably copied from Ephorus, the pupil of Isokratês. Among

One expression in this speech indicates that it was composed by
Thucydidês many years after its proper date, subsequently to
the great expedition of the Athenians against Syracuse in 415
<small>B.C.</small>; though I doubt not that Thucydidês collected the
memoranda for it at the time.
</p>
<p>
Hermokratês says: “The Athenians are now near us with <i>a few ships</i>,
lying in wait for our blunders,”—οἱ δύναμιν ἔχοντες μεγίστην τῶν
Ἑλλήνων τάς τε ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν τηροῦσιν, <em class="gesperrt">ὀλίγαις ναυσὶ παρόντες</em>,
etc. (iv, 60).
</p>
<p>
Now the fleet under the command of Eurymedon and his colleagues
at Rhegium included all or most of the ships which had acted at
Sphakteria and Korkyra, together with those which had been previously
at the strait of Messina under Pythodôrus. It could not have been
less than fifty sail, and may possibly have been sixty sail. It is
hardly conceivable that any Greek, speaking in the early spring of
424 <small>B.C.</small>, should have alluded to this as a <i>small</i> fleet:
assuredly, Hermokratês would not thus allude to it, since it was for
the interest of his argument to exaggerate rather than extenuate, the
formidable manifestations of Athens.
</p>
<p>
But Thucydidês, composing the speech after the great Athenian
expedition of 415 <small>B.C.</small>, so much more numerous and commanding
in every respect, might not unnaturally represent the fleet of
Eurymedon as “a few ships,” when he tacitly compared the two. This is
the only way that I know, of explaining such an expression.
</p>
<p>
The Scholiast observes that some of the copies in his time omitted
the words ὀλίγαις ναυσὶ: probably they noticed the contradiction
which I have remarked; and the passage <i>may</i> certainly be construed
without those words.</p>

ἐκ Σικελίας μετὰ τὴν ξύμβασιν, πολίτας τε ἐπεγράψαντο πολλοὺς,
καὶ ὁ δῆμος τὴν γῆν ἐπενόει ἀναδάσασθαι. Οἱ δὲ δυνατοὶ αἰσθόμενοι
Συρακοσίους τε ἐπάγονται καὶ ἐκβάλλουσι τὸν δῆμον. Καὶ οἱ μὲν
ἐπλανήθησαν ὡς ἕκαστοι, etc.
</p>
<p>
Upon this Dr. Arnold observes: “The principle on which this ἀναδασμὸς
γῆς was redemanded, was this; that every citizen was entitled to his
portion, κλῆρος, of the land of the state, and that the admission of
new citizens rendered a redivision of the property of the state a
matter at once of necessity and of justice. It is not probable that
in any case the actual κλῆροι (properties) of the old citizens were
required to be shared with the new members of the state; but only,
as at Rome, the ager publicus, or land still remaining to the state
itself, and not apportioned out to individuals. This land, however,
being beneficially enjoyed by numbers of the old citizens, either
as common pasture, or as being farmed by different individuals on
very advantageous terms, a division of it among the newly-admitted
citizens, although not, strictly speaking, a spoliation of private
property, was yet a serious shock to a great mass of existing
interests, and was therefore always regarded as a revolutionary
measure.”
</p>
<p>
I transcribe this note of Dr. Arnold rather from its intrinsic worth
than from any belief that analogy of agrarian relations existed
between Rome and Leontini. The ager publicus at Rome was the product
of successive conquests from foreign enemies of the city: there may,
indeed, have been originally a similar ager publicus in the peculiar
domain of Rome itself, anterior to all conquests; but this must at
any rate have been very small, and had probably been all absorbed and
assigned in private property before the agrarian disputes began.
</p>
<p>
We cannot suppose that the Leontines had any ager publicus acquired
by conquest, nor are we entitled to presume that they had any at all,
capable of being divided. Most probably the lots for the new citizens
were to be provided out of private property. But unfortunately we are
not told how, nor on what principles and conditions. Of what class of
men were the new emigrants? Were they individuals altogether poor,
having nothing but their hands to work with; or did they bring with
them any amount of funds, to begin their settlement on the fertile
and tempting plain of Leontini? (compare Thucyd. i, 27, and Plato de
Legib. v, p. 744, A.) If the latter, we have no reason to imagine
that they would be allowed to acquire their new lots gratuitously.
Existing proprietors would be forced to sell at a fixed price, but
not to yield their properties without compensation. I have already
noticed, that to a small self-working proprietor, who had no slaves,
it was almost essential that his land should be near the city; and
provided this were insured, it might be a good bargain for a new
resident having some money, but no land elsewhere, to come in and buy.
</p>
<p>
We have no means of answering these questions: but the few words
of Thucydidês do not present this measure as revolutionary, or
as intended against the rich, or for the benefit of the poor. It
was proposed, on public grounds, to strengthen the city by the
acquisition of new citizens. This might be wise policy, in the
close neighborhood of a doubtful and superior city, like Syracuse;
though we cannot judge of the policy of the measure without knowing
more. But most assuredly Mr. Mitford’s representation can be noway
justified from Thucydidês: “Time and circumstances had greatly
altered the state of property in all the Sicilian commonwealths,
since <i>that incomplete and iniquitous partition of lands</i>, which had
been made, on the general establishment of democratical government,
after the expulsion of the family of Gelon. In other cities, the poor
rested under their lot; but in Leontini, they were warm in project
<i>for a fresh and equal partition</i>; and to strengthen themselves
against the party of the wealthy, they carried, in the general
assembly, a decree for associating a number of new citizens.”
(Mitford, H. G. ch. xviii, sect. ii, vol. iv, p. 23.)
</p>
<p>
I have already remarked, in a previous note, that Mr. Mitford has
misrepresented the redivision of lands which took place after the
expulsion of the Gelonian dynasty. That redivision had not been upon
the principle of equal lots: it is not therefore correct to assert,
as Mr. Mitford does, that the present movement at Leontini arose from
the innovation made by time and circumstances in that equal division:
as little is it correct to say, that the poor at Leontini now desired
“a fresh and equal partition.” Thucydidês says <i>not one word about
equal partition</i>. He puts forward the enrolment of new citizens
as the substantive and primary resolution, actually taken by the
Leontines; the redivision of the lands, as a measure consequent and
subsidiary to this, and as yet existing only in project (ἐπενόει).
Mr. Mitford states the fresh and equal division to have been the real
object of desire, and the enrolment of new citizens to have been
proposed with a view to attain it. His representation is greatly at
variance with that of Thucydidês.</p>

word Τριφάλης was a nickname (not difficult to understand) applied

<p>
I cannot concur in the remarks of Dr. Arnold, either on this passage
or upon the parallel case of the renewed debate in the Athenian
assembly, on the subject of the punishment to be inflicted on the
Mitylenæans (see above, vol. vi, ch. 1, p. 338, and Thucyd. iii,
36). It appears to me that Nikias was here asking the prytanis to
do an illegal act, which might well expose him to accusation and
punishment. Probably he <i>would</i> have been accused on this ground, if
the decision of the second assembly had been different from what it
actually turned out; if they had reversed the decision of the former
assembly, but only by a small majority.
</p>
<p>
The distinction taken by Dr. Arnold between what was <i>illegal</i> and
what was merely <i>irregular</i>, was little marked at Athens: both were
called <i>illegal</i>, τοὺς νόμους λύειν. The rules which the Athenian
assembly, a sovereign assembly, laid down for its own debates and
decisions, were just as much <i>laws</i> as those which it passed for the
guidance of private citizens. The English House of Commons is not
a sovereign assembly, but only a portion of the sovereign power:
accordingly, the rules which it lays down for its debates are not
<i>laws</i>, but orders of the House: a breach of these orders, therefore,
in debating any particular subject, would not be illegal, but
merely irregular or informal. The same was the case with the French
Chamber of Deputies, prior to the revolution of February, 1848: the
rules which it laid down for its own proceedings were not laws,
but simply <i>le réglement de la Chambre</i>. It is remarkable that the
present National Assembly now sitting (March, 1849) has retained this
expression, and adopted a <i>réglement</i> for its own business; though
it is in point of fact a sovereign assembly, and the rules which it
sanctions are, properly speaking, <i>laws</i>.
</p>
<p>
Both in this case, and in the Mitylenæan debate, I think the Athenian
prytanis committed an illegality. In the first case, every one is
glad of the illegality, because it proved the salvation of so many
Mitylenæan lives. In the second case, the illegality was productive
of practical bad consequences, inasmuch as it seems to have brought
about the immense extension of the scale upon which the expedition
was projected. But there will occur in a few years a third incident,
the condemnation of the six generals after the battle of Arginusæ, in
which the prodigious importance of a strict observance of forms will
appear painfully and conspicuously manifest.</p>

Compare vi, 90. Plutarch (Alkib. c. 19; Nikias, c. 12). Plutarch
sometimes speaks as if, not Alkibiadês alone (or at least in
conjunction with a few partisans), but the Athenians generally, set
out with an expectation of conquering Carthage as well as Sicily.
In the speech which Alkibiadês made at Sparta after his banishment
(Thucyd. vi, 90), he does indeed state this as the general purpose
of the expedition. But it seems plain that he is here describing, to
his countrymen generally, plans which were only fermenting in his own
brain, as we may discern from a careful perusal of the first twenty
chapters of the sixth book of Thucydidês.
</p>
<p>
In the inaccurate Oratio de Pace ascribed to Andokidês (sect. 30), it
is alleged that the Syracusans sent an embassy to Athens, a little
before this expedition, entreating to be admitted as allies of the
Athenians, and affirming that Syracuse would be a more valuable ally
to Athens than Egesta or Katana. This statement is wholly untrue.</p>

<p>
Dobree and Dr. Arnold explain ὑπηρεσίαις to mean <i>the petty

construe it to mean “<i>the servants of the sailors</i>.” Neither of
the two seems to me satisfactory. I think the word means “to the
crews generally;” the word ὑπερησία being a perfectly general word
comprising all who received pay in the ship. All the examples
produced in the notes of the commentators testify this meaning, which
also occurs in the text itself two lines before. To construe ταῖς
ὑπηρεσίαις as meaning “the crews generally, or the remaining crews,
along with the thranitæ,” is doubtless more or less awkward. But it
departs less from ordinary construction than either of the two senses
which the commentators propose.</p>

Æschinês, De Fals. Legat. c. 54, p. 302, and in Andokidês, De Pace,
sect. 8, that seven thousand talents were laid by as an accumulated
treasure in the acropolis during the Peace of Nikias, and that four
hundred triremes, or three hundred triremes, were newly built. The
numerous historical inaccuracies in those orations, concerning the
facts prior to 400 <small>B.C.</small>, are such as to deprive them of all
authority, except where they are confirmed by other testimony; even
if we admitted the oration ascribed to Andokidês as genuine, which in
all probability it is not.
</p>
<p>
But there exists an interesting Inscription which proves that the sum
of three thousand talents at least must have been laid by, during
the interval between the conclusion of the Peace of Nikias and the
Sicilian Expedition, in the acropolis; and that over and above this
accumulated fund, the state was in condition to discharge, out of
the current receipts, various sums which it had borrowed during the
previous war from the treasury of various temples, and seems to have
had besides a surplus for docks and fortifications. The Inscription
above named records the vote passed for discharging these debts, and
for securing the sums so paid in the opisthodomus, or back-chamber,
of the Parthenon, for account of those gods to whom they respectively
belonged. See Boeckh’s Corp. Inscr. part ii, Inscr. Att. No. 76, p.
117; also the Staats-haushaltung der Athener of the same author, vol.

years between 421-415 <small>B.C.</small>, to which year we cannot say.</p>

Cornelius Nepos (Alkibiad. c. 3) and Plutarch (Alkib. c. 13) copy
Andokidês: in his life of Nikias (c. 18) the latter uses the
expression of Thucydidês—οἱ πλεῖστοι. This expression is noway at
variance with Andokidês, though it stops short of his affirmation.
There is great mixture of truth and falsehood in the Oration of
Andokidês; but I think that he is to be trusted as to this point.
</p>
<p>
Diodorus (xiii, 2) says that <i>all</i> the Hermæ were mutilated, not
recognizing a single exception. Cornelius Nepos, by a singular
inaccuracy, talks about the Hermæ as having been all <i>thrown down</i>
(dejicerentur).</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_245"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_245">[245]</a></span> It is truly astonishing to read the account
given of this mutilation of the Hermæ, and its consequences, by
Wachsmuth, Hellen. Alterthümer, vol. ii, sect. 65, pp. 191-196.
While he denounces the Athenian people, for their conduct during
the subsequent inquiry, in the most unmeasured language, you would
suppose that the incident which plunged them into this mental
distraction, at a moment of overflowing hope and confidence, was
a mere trifle: so briefly does he pass it over, without taking
the smallest pains to show in what way it profoundly wounded the
religious feeling of Athens.

Especially the ἀγυιατίδες θεραπεῖαι (Eurip. Ion. 187) were noted

Agam. 339. The wrath for any indignity offered to the statue of a
god or goddess, and impatience to punish it capitally, is manifested
as far back as the ancient epic poem of Arktinus: see the argument
of the Ἰλίου Πέρσις in Proclus, and Welcker, Griechische Tragödien,
<i>Sophoklês</i>, sect. 21, vol. i, p. 162. Herodotus cannot explain the
indignities offered by Kambyses to the Egyptian statues and holy
customs upon any other supposition than that of stark madness, ἐμάνη
μεγάλως; Herod. iii, 37-38.
</p>
<p>
Timæus the Sicilian historian (writing about 320-290 <small>B.C.</small>)
represented the subsequent defeat of the Athenians as a divine
punishment for the desecration of the Hermæ, inflicted chiefly by the
Syracusan Hermokratês, son of Hermon and descendant of the god Hermes
(Timæi Fragm. 103-104, ed. Didot; Longinus, de Sublim. iv, 3).
</p>
<p>
The etymological thread of connection, between the Hermæ and
Hermokratês, is strange enough: but what is of importance to remark,
is the deep-seated belief that such an act must bring after it divine
punishment, and that the Athenians as a people were collectively
responsible, unless they could appease the divine displeasure. If
this was the view taken by the historian Timæus a century and more
after the transaction, much more keenly was it present to the minds
of the Athenians of that day.</p>

Athens after the mutilation of the Hermæ:—
</p>
<p>
“We indeed see so little connection between acts of daring impiety
and designs against the state, that we can hardly understand how
they could have been associated together as they were in the minds
of the Athenians. But perhaps the difficulty may not without reason
have appeared much less to the contemporaries of Alcibiadês, who
were rather disposed by their views of religion to regard them as
inseparable.” (Hist. Gr. ch. xxv, vol. iii, p. 394.)
</p>
<p>
This remark, like so many others in Dr. Thirlwall’s history,
indicates a tone of liberality forming a striking contrast with
Wachsmuth; and rare indeed among the learned men who have undertaken
to depict the democracy of Athens. It might, however, have been
stated far more strongly; for an Athenian citizen would have had
quite as much difficulty in comprehending our <i>disjunction</i> of the
two ideas, as we have in comprehending his <i>association</i> of the two.</p>

feelings and proceedings at Athens by the mutilation of the Hermæ
were the consequence of her democratical government, may be reminded
of an analogous event of modern times from which we are not yet
separated by a century.
</p>
<p>
In the year 1766, at Abbeville in France, two young gentlemen of
good family—the Chevalier d’Etallonde and Chevalier de la Barre—were
tried, convicted, and condemned for having injured a wooden
crucifix which stood on the bridge of that town: in aggravation of
this offence they were charged with having sung indecent songs.
The evidence to prove these points was exceedingly doubtful;
nevertheless, both were condemned to have their tongues cut out by
the roots, to have their right hands cut off at the church gate,
then to be tied to a post in the market-place with an iron chain,
and burnt by a slow fire. This sentence, after being submitted by
way of appeal to the Parliament of Paris, and by them confirmed,
was actually executed upon the Chevalier de la Barre—d’Etallonde
having escaped—in July, 1766; with this mitigation, that he was
allowed to be decapitated before he was burnt; but at the same time
with this aggravation, that he was put to the torture, ordinary and
extraordinary, to compel him to disclose his accomplices (Voltaire,
Relation de la Mort du Chevalier de la Barre, Œuvres, vol. xlii, pp.
361-379, ed. Beuchot: also Voltaire, Le Cri du Sang Innocent, vol.
xii, p. 133).
</p>
<p>
I extract from this treatise a passage showing how—as in this
mutilation of the Hermæ at Athens—the occurrence of one act of
sacrilege turns men’s imagination, belief, and talk, to others, real
or imaginary:—
</p>
<p>
“Tandis que Belleval ourdissoit sécrètement cette trame, il
arriva malheureusement que le crucifix de bois, posé sur le pont
d’Abbeville, étoit endommagé, et l’on soupçonna que des soldats ivres
avoient commis cette insolence impie.
</p>
<p>
“Malheureusement l’evêque d’Amiens, étant aussi evêque d’Abbeville,
donna à cette aventure une célébrité et une importance qu’elle
ne méritoit pas. Il fit lancer des monitoires: il vint faire une
procession solennelle auprès du crucifix; <i>et on ne parla en
Abbeville que de sacrilèges pendant une année entière</i>. On disoit
qu’il se formoit une nouvelle secte qui brisoit les crucifix, qui
jettoit par terre toutes les hosties, et les perçoit à coups de
couteaux. On assuroit qu’ils avoient répandu beaucoup de sang. Il
y eut des femmes qui crurent en avoir été témoins. On renouvela
tous les contes calomnieux répandus contre les Juifs dans tant de
villes de l’Europe. Vous connoissez, Monsieur, jusqu’à quel point la
populace porte la credulité et le fanatisme, toujours encouragé par
les moines.
</p>
<p>
“La procédure une fois commencée, il y eut une foule de délations.
Chacun disoit ce qu’il avoit vu ou cru voir—ce qu’il avoit entendu ou
cru entendre.”
</p>
<p>
It will be recollected that the sentence on the Chevalier de la Barre
was passed, not by the people, nor by any popular judicature, but
by a limited court of professional judges sitting at Abbeville, and
afterwards confirmed by the Parlement de Paris, the first tribunal of
professional judges in France.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_264"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_264">[264]</a></span> The account which Andokidês gives of the first
accusation against Alkibiadês by Pythonikus, in the assembly,
prior to the departure of the fleet, presents the appearance of
being substantially correct, and I have followed it in the text.
It is in harmony with the more brief indications of Thucydidês.
But when Andokidês goes on to say, that “in consequence of this
information, Polystratus was seized and put to death, while the rest
of the parties denounced fled, and were condemned to death in their
absence,” (sect. 13,) this cannot be true. Alkibiadês most certainly
did not flee, and was not condemned at <i>that time</i>. If Alkibiadês
was not then tried, neither could the other persons have been tried,
who were denounced as his accomplices in the same offence. My belief
is that this information, having been first presented by the enemies
of Alkibiadês before the sailing of the fleet, was dropped entirely
for that time, both against him and against his accomplices. It was
afterwards resumed, when the information of Andokidês himself had
satisfied the Athenians on the question of the Hermokopids: and the
impeachment presented by Thessalus son of Kimon against Alkibiadês,
was founded, in part at least, upon the information presented by
Andromachus.
</p>
<p>
If Polystratus was put to death at all, it could only have been
on this second bringing forward of the charge, at the time when
Alkibiadês was sent for and refused to come home. But we may well
doubt whether he was put to death at that time or on that ground,
when we see how inaccurate the statement of Andokidês is as to the
consequences of the information of Andromachus. He mentions Panætius
as one of those who fled in consequence of that information, and were
condemned in their absence: but Panætius appears afterwards, in the
very same speech, as <i>not</i> having fled at that time (sects. 13, 52,
67). Harpokration states (v. Πολύστρατος), on the authority of an
oration ascribed to Lysias, that Polystratus was put to death on the
charge of having been concerned in the mutilation of the Hermæ. This
is quite different from the statement of Andokidês, and would lead us
to suppose that Polystratus was one of those against whom Andokidês
himself informed.</p>

not specified by historians, but the account of Thucydidês makes
it evident, that there had been a revolution in the government of
Syracuse, or at least a great change in its administration, since
the oligarchical Leontines were admitted to the rights of Syracusan
citizens (ch. xviii, sect. iii, vol. iv, p. 46). The democratical
party now bore the sway,” etc.
</p>
<p>
I cannot imagine upon what passage of Thucydidês Mr. Mitford founds
this conjecture, which appears to me pure fancy. He had spoken of the
government as a democracy before, he continues to speak of it as a
democracy now, in the same unaltered vituperative strain.</p>

That “habitual quiescence” which Hermokratês here predicates of his
countrymen, forms a remarkable contrast with the restless activity,
and intermeddling carried even to excess, which Periklês and Nikias
deprecate in the Athenians (Thucyd. i, 144; vi, 7). Both of the
governments, however, were democratical. This serves as a lesson of
caution respecting general predications about <i>all</i> democracies;
for it is certain that one democracy differed in many respects from
another. It may be doubted, however, whether the attribute here
ascribed by Hermokratês to his countrymen was really deserved, to the
extent which his language implies.</p>

The position ascribed here to Athenagoras seems to be the same as

</p>
<p>
Neither δήμου προστάτης nor δημαγωγὸς, denotes any express functions,
or titular office (see the note of Dr. Arnold), at least in these
places. It is possible that there may have been some Grecian town
constitutions, in which there was an office bearing that title:
but this is a point which cannot be affirmed. Nor would the words
δήμου προστάτης always imply an equal degree of power: the person so
designated might have more power in one town than in another. Thus
in Megara (iv, 67) it seems that the oligarchical party had recently
been banished: the leaders of the popular party had become the most
influential men in the city. See also iii, 70, Peithias at Korkyra.</p>

</p>
<p>
Dr. Arnold translates φύλακας χρημάτων, “having the care of the
public purse,” as if it were φύλακας τῶν δημοσίων χρημάτων. But it
seems to me that the words carry a larger sense, and refer to the
private property of these rich men, not to their functions as keepers
of what was collected from taxation or tribute. Looking at a rich
man from the point of view of the public, he is guardian of his own
property until the necessities of the state require that he should
spend more or less of it for the public defence or benefit: in the
interim, he enjoys it as he pleases, but he will for his own interest
take care that the property does not perish (compare vi, 9). This is
the service which he renders, <i>quatenus</i>, <i>rich man</i>, to the state;
he may also serve it in other ways, but that would be by means of
his personal qualities; thus he may, for example, be intelligent as
well as rich (ξυνετὸς as well as πλούσιος), and then he may serve
the state as <i>counsellor</i>, the second of the two categories named by
Athenagoras. What that orator is here negativing is, the better title
and superior fitness of the rich to exercise command, which was the
claim put forward in their behalf. And he goes on to indicate what
is their real position and service in a democracy; that they are to
enjoy the revenue, and preserve the capital, of their wealth, subject
to demands for public purposes when necessary, but not to expect
command, unless they are personally competent. Properly speaking,
that which he here affirms is true of the small lots of property
taken in the mass, as well as of the large, and is one of the grounds
of defence of private property against communism. But the rich man’s
property is an appreciable item to the state, individually taken;
moreover, he is perpetually raising unjust pretensions to political
power, so that it becomes necessary to define how much he is really
entitled to.</p>

reference to the deposition of Agaristê, Andokidês again includes
Alkibiadês among those who fled into banishment in consequence of
it. Unless we are to suppose another Alkibiadês, not the general in
Sicily, this statement cannot be true. There was another Alkibiadês,
of the deme Phegus: but Andokidês in mentioning him afterwards (sect.

<p id="Footnote_291"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_291">[291]</a></span> Andokidês (sects. 13-34) affirms that some of the
persons, accused by Teukrus as mutilators of the Hermæ, were put
to death upon his deposition. But I contest his accuracy on this
point. For Thucydidês recognizes no one as having been put to death
except those against whom Andokidês himself informed (see vi, 27,
53, 61). He dwells particularly upon the number of persons, and
persons of excellent character, imprisoned on suspicion; but he
mentions none as having been put to death except those against whom
Andokidês gave testimony. He describes it as a great harshness,
and as an extraordinary proof of the reigning excitement, that the
Athenians should have detained so many persons upon suspicion, on
the evidence of informers not entitled to credence. But he would not
have specified this detention as extraordinary harshness, if the
Athenians had gone so far as to put individuals to death upon the
same evidence. Besides, to put these men to death would have defeated
their own object, the full and entire disclosure of the plot and the
conspirators. The ignorance in which they were of their internal
enemies, was among the most agonizing of all their sentiments; and to
put any prisoner to death until they arrived, or believed themselves
to have arrived, at the knowledge of the whole, would tend so far to
bar their own chance of obtaining evidence: ὁ δὲ δῆμος ὁ τῶν Ἀθηναίων
ἄσμενος λαβὼν, ὡς ᾤετο, τὸ σαφὲς, καὶ δεινὸν ποιούμενοι πρότερον εἰ

<p>
Wachsmuth says (p. 194): “The bloodthirsty dispositions of the people
had been excited by the previous murders: the greater the number of
victims to be slaughtered, the better were the people pleased,” etc.
This is an inaccuracy quite in harmony with the general spirit of
his narrative. It is contradicted, implicitly, by the very words of
Thucydidês which he transcribes in his note 108.</p>

that this testimony was glaringly false, since on the night in
question it was <i>new moon</i>. I presume, at least, that the remark of
Diodorus refers to the deposition of Diokleidês, though he never
mentions the name of the latter, and even describes the deposition
referred to with many material variations as compared with Andokidês.
Plutarch’s observation certainly refers to Diokleidês, whose
deposition, he says, affirming that he had seen and distinguished the
persons in question by the light of the moon, on a night when it was
<i>new</i> moon, shocked all sensible men, but produced no effect upon the
blind fury of the people. Wachsmuth (Hellenisch. Alterth. vol. ii,
ch. viii, p. 194) copies this remark from Plutarch.
</p>
<p>
I disbelieve altogether the assertion that it was <i>new moon</i> on that
night. Andokidês gives in great detail the deposition of Diokleidês,
with a strong wish to show that it was false and perfidiously got
up. But he nowhere mentions the fact that it was <i>new moon</i> on the
night in question; though if we read his report and his comments upon
the deposition of Diokleidês, we shall see that he never could have
omitted such a means of discrediting the whole tale, if the fact had
been so (Andokid. de Myster. sects. 37-43). Besides, it requires very
good positive evidence to make us believe, that a suborned informer,
giving his deposition not long after one of the most memorable nights
that ever passed at Athens, would be so clumsy as to make particular
reference to the circumstance that it was <i>full moon</i> (εἶναι δὲ
πανσέληνον), if it had really been <i>new moon</i>.</p>

<p id="Footnote_298"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_298">[298]</a></span> Considering the extreme alarm which then pervaded the
Athenian mind, and their conviction that there were traitors among
themselves whom yet they could not identify, it is to be noted as
remarkable that they resisted the proposition of their commissioners
for applying torture. We must recollect that the Athenians admitted
the principle of the torture, as a good mode of eliciting truth as
well as of testing depositions,—for they applied it often to the
testimony of slaves,—sometimes apparently to that of metics. Their
attachment to the established law, which forbade the application of
it to citizens, must have been very great, to enable them to resist
the great special and immediate temptation to apply it in this case
to Mantitheus and Aphepsion, if only by way of exception.
</p>
<p>
The application of torture to witnesses and suspected persons,
handed down from the Roman law, was in like manner recognized, and
pervaded nearly all the criminal jurisprudence of Europe until the
last century. I hope that the reader, after having gone through the
painful narrative of the proceedings of the Athenians after the
mutilation of the Hermæ, will take the trouble to peruse by way
of comparison the <i>Storia della Colonna Infame</i>, by the eminent
Alexander Manzoni, author of “I Promessi Sposi.” This little volume,
including a republication of Verri’s “Osservazioni sulla Tortura,”
is full both of interest and instruction. It lays open the judicial
enormities committed at Milan in 1630, while the terrible pestilence
was raging there, by the examining judges and the senate, in order
to get evidence against certain suspected persons called <i>Untori</i>;
that is, men who were firmly believed by the whole population, with
very few exceptions, to be causing and propagating the pestilence by
means of certain ointment which they applied to the doors and walls
of houses. Manzoni recounts with simple, eloquent, and impressive
detail, the incredible barbarity with which the official lawyers
at Milan, under the authority of the senate, extorted, by force of
torture, evidence against several persons, of having committed this
imaginary and impossible crime. The persons thus convicted were
executed under horrible torments: the house of one of them, a barber
named Mora, was pulled down, and a pillar with an inscription erected
upon the site, to commemorate the deed. This pillar, the <i>Colonna
Infame</i>, remained standing in Milan until the close of the 18th
century. The reader will understand, from Manzoni’s narrative, the
degree to which public excitement and alarm can operate to poison
and barbarize the course of justice in a Christian city, without
a taint of democracy, and with professional lawyers and judges to
guide the whole procedure secretly, as compared with a pagan city,
ultra-democratical, where judicial procedure as well as decision was
all oral, public, and multitudinous.</p>

If the statement of Andokidês in the Oratio de Mysteriis is correct,
the deposition previously given by Teukrus the metic must have been
a true one; though this man is commonly denounced among the lying
witnesses (see the words of the comic writer Phrynichus ap. Plutarch,
Alkib. c. 20).
</p>
<p>
Thucydidês refuses even to mention the name of Andokidês, and
expresses himself with more than usual reserve about this dark
transaction, as if he were afraid of giving offence to great Athenian
families. The bitter feuds which it left behind at Athens, for years
afterwards, are shown in the two orations of Lysias and of Andokidês.
If the story of Didymus be true, that Thucydidês after his return
from exile to Athens died by a violent death (see Biogr. Thucyd.
p. xvii. ed. Arnold), it would seem probable that all his reserve
did not protect him against private enmities arising out of his
historical assertions.</p>

impieties, one of which consisted in celebrating festivals on unlucky
and forbidden days, “in derision of our gods and our laws,”—ὡς
καταλεγῶντες τῶν θεῶν καὶ τῶν νόμων τῶν ἡμετέρων. The lamentable
consequences which the displeasure of the gods had brought upon them
are then set forth: the companions of Kinêsias had all miserably
perished, while Kinêsias himself was living in wretched health

I transcribe the following extract from a work of authority on French
criminal jurisprudence—<i>Jousse</i>, Traité de la Justice Criminelle,
Paris, 1771, part iv, tit. 27, vol. iii, p. 672:—
</p>
<p>
“Du Crime de Leze-Majesté Divine.—Les Crimes de Leze Majesté Divine,
sont ceux qui attaquent Dieu immédiatement, et qu’on doit regarder
par cette raison comme les plus atroces et les plus exécrables.—La
Majesté de Dieu peut être offensée de plusieurs manières.—1. En
niant l’existence de Dieu. 2. Par le crime de ceux qui attentent
directement contre la Divinité: comme quand on profane ou qu’on foule
aux pieds les saintes Hosties; ou qu’on <i>frappe les Images de Dieu</i>
dans le dessein de l’insulter. C’est ce qu’on appelle <i>Crime de
Leze-Majesté Divine au prémier Chef</i>.”
</p>
<p>
Again in the same work, part iv, tit. 46, n. 5, 8, 10, 11, vol. iv,
pp. 97-99:—
</p>
<p>
“<i>La profanation des Sacremens et des Mystères de la Réligion est
un sacrilège des plus exécrables.</i> Tel est le crime de ceux qui
emploient les choses sacrées à des usages communs et mauvais, <i>en
dérision des Mystères</i>; ceux qui <i>profanent la sainte Eucharistie</i>,
ou qui en abusent en quelque manière que ce soit; ceux qui en
mépris de la Réligion, profanent les Fonts-Baptismaux; qui jettent
par terre les saintes Hosties, ou qui les emploient à des usages
vils et profanes: <i>ceux qui, en dérision de nos sacrés Mystères,
les contrefont dans leurs débauches; ceux qui frappent, mutilent,
abattent, les Images consacrées à Dieu, ou à la Sainte Vierge, ou
aux Saints</i>, en mépris de la Réligion; et enfin, tous ceux qui
commettent de semblables impiétés. Tous ces crimes <i>sont des crimes
de Leze-Majesté divine au prémier chef</i>, parce qu’ils s’attaquent
immédiatement à Dieu, et ne se font à aucun dessein que de
l’offenser.”
</p>
<p>
“... La peine du Sacrilège, par l’Ancien Testament, étoit celle
du feu, et d’être lapidé.—Par les Loix Romaines, les coupables
étoient condamnés au fer, au feu, et aux bêtes farouches, suivant
les circonstances.—En France, la peine du sacrilège est arbitraire,
et dépend de la qualité et des circonstances du crime, du lieu, du
temps, et de la qualité de l’accusé.—Dans <i>le sacrilège au prémier
chef, qui attaque la Divinité, la Sainte Vierge, et les Saints</i>, v.
g. à l’égard de ceux qui foulent aux pieds les saintes Hosties, ou
qui les jettent à terre, ou en abusent, et qui les emploient à des
usages vils et profanes, la peine est le feu, l’amende honorable,
et le poing coupé. Il en est de même de ceux qui profanent les
Fonts-Baptismaux; <i>ceux qui, en dérision de nos Mystères, s’en
moquent et les contrefont dans leurs débauches</i>: ils doivent être
punis de peine capitale, parce que ces crimes attaquent immédiatement
la Divinité.”

<p>
M. Jousse proceeds to cite several examples of persons condemned to
death for acts of sacrilege, of the nature above described.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_321"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_321">[321]</a></span> The proceedings in England in 1678 and 1679, in
consequence of the pretended Popish Plot, have been alluded to by
various authors, and recently by Dr. Thirlwall, as affording an
analogy to that which occurred at Athens after the mutilation of the
Hermæ. But there are many material differences, and all, so far as I
can perceive, to the advantage of Athens.
</p>
<p>
1. The “hellish and damnable plot of the Popish Recusants,” (to adopt
the words of the Houses of Lords and Commons,—see Dr. Lingard’s
History of England, vol. xiii, ch. v, p. 88,—words, the like of which
were doubtless employed at Athens in reference to the Hermokopids,)
was baseless, mendacious, and incredible, from the beginning. It
started from no real fact: the whole of it was a tissue of falsehoods
and fabrications proceeding from Oates, Bedloe, and a few other
informers of the worst character.
</p>
<p>
At Athens, there was unquestionably a plot; the Hermokopids were
real conspirators, not few in number. No one could doubt that they
conspired for other objects besides the mutilation of the Hermæ.
At the same time, no one knew what these objects were, nor who the
conspirators themselves were.
</p>
<p>
If before the mutilation of the Hermæ, a man like Oates had pretended
to reveal to the Athenian people a fabricated plot implicating
Alkibiadês and others, he would have found no credence. It was not
until after and by reason of that terror-striking incident, that
the Athenians began to give credence to informers. And we are to
recollect that they did not put any one to death on the evidence
of these informers. They contented themselves with imprisoning on
suspicion, until they got the confession and deposition of Andokidês.
Those implicated in <i>that</i> deposition were condemned to death. Now
Andokidês, as a witness, deserves but very qualified confidence; yet
it is impossible to degrade him to the same level even as Teukrus or
Diokleidês, much less to that of Oates and Bedloe. We cannot wonder
that the people trusted him, and, under the peculiar circumstances
of the case, it was the least evil that they should trust him. The
witnesses upon whose testimony the prisoners under the Popish Plot
were condemned, were even inferior to Teukrus and Diokleidês in
presumptive credibility.
</p>
<p>
The Athenian people have been censured for their folly in believing
the democratical constitution in danger, because the Hermæ had
been mutilated. I have endeavored to show, that, looking to their
religious ideas, the thread of connection between these two ideas is
perfectly explicable. And why are we to quarrel with the Athenians
because they took arms, and put themselves on their guard, when a
Lacedæmonian or a Bœotian armed force was actually on their frontier?
</p>
<p>
As for the condemnation of Alkibiadês and others for profaning and
divulging the Eleusinian mysteries, these are not for a moment to be
put upon a level with the condemnations in the Popish Plot. These
were true charges, at least there is strong presumptive reason for
believing that they were true. Persons were convicted and punished
for having done acts which they really had done, and which they knew
to be legal crimes. Whether it be right to constitute such acts legal
crimes, or not, is another question. The enormity of the Popish Plot
consisted in punishing persons for acts which they had not done, and
upon depositions of the most lying and worthless witnesses.
</p>
<p>
The state of mind into which the Athenians were driven after the
cutting of the Hermæ, was indeed very analogous to that of the
English people during the circulation of the Popish Plot. The
suffering, terror, and distraction, I apprehend to have been even
greater at Athens: but the cause of it was graver and more real, and
the active injustice which it produced was far less than in England.
</p>
<p>
“I shall not detain the reader (says Dr. Lingard, Hist. Engl. xiii,
p. 105) with a narrative of the partial trials and judicial murders
of the unfortunate men, whose names had been inserted by Oates in his
pretended discoveries. So violent was the excitement, so general the
delusion created by the perjuries of the informer, that the voice of
reason and the claims of justice were equally disregarded. Both judge
and jury seemed to have no other object than to inflict vengeance on
the supposed traitors. To speak in support of their witnesses, or
to hint the improbability of the informations, required a strength
of mind, a recklessness of consequences, which falls to the lot of
few individuals: even the king himself, convinced as he was of the
imposture, and contemptuously as he spoke of it in private, dared not
exercise his prerogative of mercy to save the lives of the innocent.”
</p>
<p>
It is to be noted that the House of Lords, both acting as a
legislative body, and in their judicial character when the Catholic
Lord Stafford was tried before them (ch. vi, pp. 231-241), displayed
a degree of prejudice and injustice quite equal to that of the judges
and juries in the law-courts.
</p>
<p>
Both the English judicature on this occasion, and the Milanese
judicature on the occasion adverted to in a previous note, were more
corrupted and driven to greater injustice by the reigning prejudice,
than the purely popular dikastery of Athens in this affair of the
Hermæ, and of the other profanations.</p>

release, upon private contract of a definite sum. Had Thucydidês said
ἀπέδοντο, it would have meant that they were put up to auction for

my judgment, more admissible than that proposed in the note of Dr.

priests.

disgraceful to be driven out of Sicily by superior force, or to <i>send
back here afterwards for fresh reinforcements, through our own fault
in making bad calculations at first</i>.” (Thucyd. vi, 21.)
</p>
<p>
This was a part of the last speech by Nikias himself at Athens, prior
to the expedition. The Athenian people in reply had passed a vote
that he and his colleagues should fix their own amount of force,
and should have everything which they asked for. Moreover, such was
the feeling in the city, that every one individually was anxious to
put down his name to serve (vi, 26-31). Thucydidês can hardly find
words sufficient to depict the completeness, the grandeur, the wealth
public and private, of the armament.
</p>
<p>
As this goes to establish what I have advanced in the text,—that the
actions of Nikias in Sicily stand most of all condemned by his own
previous speeches at Athens,—so it seems to have been forgotten by
Dr. Arnold, when he wrote his note on the remarkable passage, ii, 65,
of Thucydidês,—ἐξ ὧν ἄλλα τε πολλὰ, ὡς ἐν μεγάλῃ πόλει, καὶ ἀρχὴν
ἐχούσῃ, ἡμαρτήθη, καὶ ὁ ἐς Σικελίαν πλοῦς· ὃς οὐ τοσοῦτον γνώμης
ἁμάρτημα ἦν πρὸς οὓς ἐπῄεσαν, ὅσον <em class="gesperrt">οἱ ἐκπέμψαντες, οὐ τὰ πρόσφορα
τοῖς οἰχομένοις ἐπιγιγνώσκοντες</em>, ἀλλὰ κατὰ τὰς ἰδίας διαβολὰς
περὶ τῆς τοῦ δήμου προστασίας, τά τε ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ ἀμβλύτερα
ἐποίουν, καὶ τὰ περὶ τὴν πόλιν πρῶτον ἐν ἀλλήλοις ἐταράχθησαν. Upon
which Dr. Arnold remarks:—
</p>
<p>
“Thucydidês here expresses the same opinion which he repeats in two
other places (vi, 31; vii, 42). namely, that the Athenian power was
fully adequate to the conquest of Syracuse, <i>had not the expedition
been mismanaged by the general, and insufficiently supplied by
the government at home</i>. The words οὐ τὰ πρόσφορα τοῖς οἰχομένοις
ἐπιγιγνώσκοντες signify “<i>not voting afterwards the needful supplies
to their absent armament</i>:” for Nikias was prevented from improving
his first victory over the Syracusans by the want of cavalry and
money; and the whole winter was lost before he could get supplied
from Athens. And subsequently the armament was allowed to be reduced
to great distress and weakness, before the second expedition was sent
to reinforce it.” Göller and Poppo concur in this explanation.
</p>
<p>
Let us in the first place discuss the explanation here given of the
words τὰ πρόσφορα ἐπιγιγνώσκοντες. It appears to me that these words
do <i>not</i> signify “<i>voting the needful supplies</i>.”
</p>
<p>
The word ἐπιγιγνώσκειν cannot be used in the same sense with
ἐπιπέμπειν—παρασχεῖν (vii, 2-15), ἐκπορίζειν. As it would not be
admissible to say ἐπιγιγνώσκειν ὅπλα, νῆας, ἵππους, χρήματα, etc.,
so neither can it be right to say ἐπιγιγνώσκειν τὰ πρόσφορα, if
this latter word were used only as a comprehensive word for these
particulars, meaning “<i>supplies</i>.” The words really mean: “<i>taking
farther resolutions</i> (after the expedition was gone) <i>unsuitable or
mischievous to the absent armament</i>.” Πρόσφορα is used here quite
generally, agreeing with βουλεύματα, or some such word: indeed, we
find the phrase τὰ πρόσφορα used in the most general sense, for
“what is suitable;” “what is advantageous or convenient:” γυμνάσω τὰ
πρόσφορα—πράσσεται τὰ πρόσφορα—τὰ πρόσφορ’ ηὔξατ’—τὰ πρόσφορα δρῳης
ἂν—τὸ ταῖσδε πρόσφορον. Euripid. Hippol. 112; Alkestis, 148; Iphig.
Aul. 160, B; Helen. 1299; Troades, 304.
</p>
<p>
Thucydidês appears to have in view the violent party contests which
broke out in reference to the Hermæ and the other irreligious acts
at Athens, after the departure of the armament, especially to the
mischief of recalling Alkibiadês, which grew out of those contests.
He does not allude to the withholding of supplies from the armament;
nor was it the purpose of any of the parties at Athens to withhold
them. The party acrimony was directed against Alkibiadês exclusively,
not against the expedition.
</p>
<p>
Next, as to the main allegation in Dr. Arnold’s note, that <i>one of
the causes</i> of the failure of the Athenian expedition in Sicily,
was, that it was “insufficiently supplied by Athens.” Of the two
passages to which he refers in Thucydidês (vi, 31; vii, 42), the
first distinctly contradicts this allegation, by setting forth the
prodigious amount of force sent; the second says nothing about it,
and indirectly discountenances it, by dwelling upon the glaring
blunders of Nikias.
</p>
<p>
After the Athenians had allowed Nikias in the spring to name and
collect the force which he thought requisite, how could they expect
to receive a demand for farther reinforcements in the autumn, the
army having really done nothing? Nevertheless, the supplies <i>were
sent</i>, as soon as they could be, and as soon as Nikias expected them.
If the whole winter was lost, that was not the fault of the Athenians.
</p>
<p>
Still harder is it in Dr. Arnold, to say, “that the armament <i>was
allowed</i> to be reduced to great distress and weakness before the
second expedition was sent to reinforce it.” The second expedition
was sent the moment that Nikias made known his distress and asked
for it; his intimation of distress coming quite suddenly, almost
immediately after most successful appearances.
</p>
<p>
It appears to me that nothing can be more incorrect or inconsistent
with the whole tenor of the narrative of Thucydidês, than to
charge the Athenians with having starved their expedition. What
they are really chargeable with, is, the having devoted to it a
disproportionate fraction of their entire strength, perfectly
enormous and ruinous. And so Thucydidês plainly conceives it, when he
is describing both the armament of Nikias and that of Demosthenês.
</p>
<p>
Thucydidês is very reserved in saying anything against Nikias, whom
he treats throughout with the greatest indulgence and tenderness.
But he lets drop quite sufficient to prove that he conceived the
mismanagement of the general as <i>the cause</i> of the failure of the
armament, not as “one of two causes,” as Dr. Arnold here presents
it. Of course, I recognize fully the consummate skill, and the
aggressive vigor so unusual in a Spartan, of Gylippus, together with
the effective influence which this exercised upon the result. But
Gylippus would never have set foot in Syracuse, had he not been let
in, first through the apathy, next through the contemptuous want of
precaution, shown by Nikias (vii, 42).</p>

<p id="Footnote_350"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_350">[350]</a></span> Plutarch (Alkib. c. 23) says that he went to reside
at Argos; but this seems difficult to reconcile with the assertion
of Thucydidês (vi, 61) that his friends at Argos had incurred grave
suspicions of treason.
</p>
<p>
Cornelius Nepos (Alkib. c. 4) says, with greater probability of
truth, that Alkibiadês went from Thurii, first to Elis, next to
Thebes.
</p>
<p>
Isokratês (De Bigis, Orat. xvi, s. 10) says that the Athenians
banished him out of all Greece, inscribed his name on a column,
and sent envoys to demand his person from the Argeians; so that
Alkibiadês <i>was compelled</i> to take refuge with the Lacedæmonians.
This whole statement of Isokratês is exceedingly loose and
untrustworthy, carrying back the commencement of the conspiracy of
the Four Hundred to a time anterior to the banishment of Alkibiadês.
But among all the vague sentences, this allegation that the Athenians
banished him out of <i>all Greece</i> stands prominent. They could only
banish him from the territory of Athens and her allies. Whether he
went to Argos, as I have already said, seems to me very doubtful:
perhaps Plutarch copied the statement from this passage of Isokratês.
</p>
<p>
But under all circumstances, we are not to believe that Alkibiadês
turned against his country, or went to Sparta, <i>upon compulsion</i>.
The first act of his hostility to Athens, the disappointing her of
the acquisition of Messênê, was committed before he left Sicily.
Moreover, Thucydidês represents him as unwilling indeed to go to
Sparta, but only unwilling because he was afraid of the Spartans; in
fact, waiting for a safe-conduct and invitation from them. Thucydidês
mentions nothing about his going to Argos (vi, 88).</p>

It is to be recollected that the Lacedæmonians had been always
opposed to τύραννοι, or despots, and had been particularly opposed to

democratical tendencies, therefore, to this source, Alkibiadês took
the best means of excusing them before a Lacedæmonian audience.</p>

Thucyd. vi, 98, says that the Circle is spoken of, in one passage of
Thucydidês, as if it had <i>never been completed</i>. I construe this one
passage differently from him (vii, 2, 4)—τῷ ἄλλῳ τοῦ κύκλου πρὸς τὸν
Τρώγιλον ἐπὶ τὴν ἑτέραν θάλασσαν: where I think τῷ ἄλλῳ τοῦ κύκλου
is equivalent to ἑτέρωθι τοῦ κύκλου, as plainly appears from the
accompanying mention of Trogilus and the northern sea. I am persuaded
that the Circle was finished; and Dr. Arnold himself indicates
two passages in which it is distinctly spoken of as having been
completed.</p>

τεῖχος· καὶ εἰ φθάσειαν, ἀποκλῄσεις γίγνεσθαι, καὶ ἅμα καὶ ἐν τούτῳ

δὲ ἂν παυομένους τοῦ ἔργου πάντας ἂν πρὸς σφᾶς τρέπεσθαι.
</p>
<p>
The Scholiast here explains τὰς ἐφόδους to mean τὰ βάσιμα; adding
ὀλίγα δὲ τὰ ἐπιβαθῆναι δυνάμενα, διὰ τὸ τελματῶδες εἶναι τὸ χωρίον.
Though he is here followed by the best commentators, I cannot
think that his explanation is correct. He evidently supposes that
this first counter-wall of the Syracusans was built—as we shall
see presently that the second counter-work was—across the marsh,
or low ground between the southern cliff of Epipolæ and the Great
Harbor. “The ground being generally marshy (τελματῶδες) there were
only a few places where it could be crossed.” But I conceive this
supposition to be erroneous. The first counter-wall of the Syracusans
was carried, as it seems to me, up the slope of Epipolæ, between the
Athenian circle and the southern cliff: it commenced at the Syracusan
newly-erected advanced wall, inclosing the Temenitês. This was all
hard, firm ground, such as the Athenians could march across at any
point: there might perhaps be some roughness here and there, but they
would be mere exceptions to the general character of the ground.
</p>
<p>
It appears to me that τὰς ἐφόδους means simply, “the attacks of
the Athenians,” without intending to denote any special assailable
points; προκαταλαμβάνειν τὰς ἐφόδους, means “to get beforehand with
the attacks,” (see Thucyd. i, 57, v, 30.) This is in fact the more
usual meaning of ἔφοδος (compare vii, 5; vii, 43; i, 6; v, 35; vi,
63), “attack, approach, visit,” etc. There are doubtless other
passages in which it means, “the way or road through which the attack
was made:” in one of these, however (vii, 51), all the best editors
now read ἐσόδου instead of ἐφόδου.
</p>
<p>
It will be seen that arguments have been founded upon the
inadmissible sense which the Scholiast here gives to the word ἔφοδοι:
see Dr. Arnold, Memoir on the Map of Syracuse, Appendix to his ed. of
Thucyd. vol. iii, p. 271.</p>

</p>
<p>
I give in the text what I believe to be the meaning of this
sentence, though the words ἀπὸ τοῦ κύκλου are not clear, and have
been differently construed. Göller, in his first edition, had
construed them as if it stood <em class="gesperrt">ἀρξάμενοι</em> ἀπὸ τοῦ κύκλου: as
if the fortification now begun on the cliff was continuous and in
actual junction with the Circle. In his second edition, he seems to
relinquish this opinion, and to translate them in a manner similar
to Dr. Arnold, who considers them as equivalent to ἀπὸ τοῦ κύκλου
ὁρμώμενοι, but not at all implying that the fresh work performed
was continuous with the Circle, which he believes not to have been
the fact. If thus construed, the words would imply, “starting from
the Circle as a base of operations.” Agreeing with Dr. Arnold in
his conception of the event signified, I incline, in construing
the words, to proceed upon the analogy of two or three passages in
Thucyd. i, 7; i, 46; i, 99; vi, 64—Αἱ δὲ παλαιαὶ πόλεις διὰ τὴν
λῃστείαν ἐπιπολὺ ἀντισχοῦσαν <em class="gesperrt">ἀπὸ θαλάσσης μᾶλλον ᾠκίσθησαν</em> ...

Ἐλαιάτιδι τῆς Θεσπρώτιδος, Ἐφύρη. In these passages ἀπὸ is used in
the same sense as we find ἄποθεν, iv, 125, signifying “apart from,
at some distance from;” but not implying any accompanying idea of
motion, or proceeding from, either literal or metaphorical.

the cliff above the marsh,” etc.</p>

</p>
<p>
Though all the commentators here construe the words κατὰ Βορέαν
ἑστηκὼς as if they agreed with ὃς or ἄνεμος, I cannot but think that
these words really agree with Γύλιππος. Gylippus is overtaken by
this violent off-shore wind while he is sailing southward along the
eastern shore of what is now called Calabria Ultra: “setting his ship
towards the north or <i>standing to the north</i> (to use the English
nautical phrase), he is carried out to sea, from whence, after great
difficulties, he again gets into Tarentum.” If Gylippus was carried
out to sea when in this position, and trying to get to Tarentum, he
would naturally lay his course northward. What is meant by the words
κατὰ Βορέαν ἑστηκὼς, as applied <i>to the wind</i>, I confess I do not
understand; nor do the critics throw much light upon it. Whenever a
point of the compass is mentioned in conjunction with any wind, it
always seems to mean the point <i>from whence</i> the wind blows. Now,
that κατὰ Βορέαν ἑστηκὼς means “a wind which blows steadily from the
north,” as the commentators affirm, I cannot believe without better
authority than they produce. Moreover, Gylippus could never have laid
his course for Tarentum, if there had been a strong wind in this
direction; while such a wind would have forwarded him to Lokri, the
very place whither he wanted to go. The mention of the <i>Terinæan</i>
gulf is certainly embarrassing. If the words are right (which perhaps
may be doubted), the explanation of Dr. Arnold in his note seems the
best which can be offered. Perhaps, indeed,—for though improbable,
this is not wholly impossible,—Thucydidês may himself have committed
a geographical inadvertence, in supposing the Terinæan gulf to be on
the east side of Calabria.</p>

<p>
These words of Thucydidês are very obscure, and have been explained
by different commentators in different ways. The explanation which
I here give does not, so far as I know, coincide with any of them;
yet I venture to think that it is the most plausible, and the only
one satisfactory. Compare the Memoir of Dr. Arnold on his Map of
Syracuse (Arn. Thucyd. vol. iii, p. 273), and the notes of Poppo and
Göller. Dr. Arnold is indeed so little satisfied with any explanation
which had suggested itself to him that he thinks some words must have
dropped out.</p>

<p id="Footnote_403"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_403">[403]</a></span> Thucyd. vii, 9. ἐν ἄλλαις πολλαῖς ἐπιστολαῖς. The
word <i>despatches</i>, which I use to translate ἐπιστολαῖς, is not
inapplicable to oral, as well as to written messages, and thus
retains the ambiguity involved in the original; for ἐπιστολαῖς,
though usually implying, does not necessarily imply, <i>written</i>
communications.
</p>
<p>
The words of Thucydidês (vii, 8) <i>may</i> certainly be construed to
imply that Nikias had never on any previous occasion sent a written
communication to Athens; and so Dr. Thirlwall understands them,
though not without hesitation (Hist. Gr. ch. xxvi, vol. iii, p. 418).
At the same time, I think them reconcilable with the supposition
that Nikias may previously have sent written despatches, though much
shorter than the present, leaving details and particulars to be
supplied by the officer who carried them.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Mitford states the direct reverse of that which Dr. Thirlwall
understands: “Nicias had used the precaution of frequently sending
despatches in writing, with an exact account of every transaction.”
(Ch. xviii, sect v, vol. iv, p. 100.)
</p>
<p>
Certainly, the statement of Thucydidês does not imply this.</p>

<p id="Footnote_405"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_405">[405]</a></span> Thucyd. vii, 13. Καὶ οἱ ξένοι οἱ μὲν ἀναγκαστοὶ
ἐσβάντες, εὐθὺς κατὰ τὰς πόλεις ἀποχωροῦσιν, οἱ δὲ ὑπὸ μεγάλου μισθοῦ
τὸ πρῶτον ἐπαρθέντες, καὶ οἰόμενοι χρηματιεῖσθαι μᾶλλον ἢ μαχεῖσθαι,
ἐπειδὴ παρὰ γνώμην ναύτικόν τε δὴ καὶ τἄλλα ἀπὸ τῶν πολεμίων
ἀνθεστῶτα ὁρῶσιν, οἱ μὲν <em class="gesperrt">ἐπ’ αὐτομολίας προφάσει ἀπέρχονται</em>,
οἱ δὲ ὡς ἕκαστοι δύνανται· πολλὴ δ’ ἡ Σικελία.
</p>
<p>
All the commentators bestow long notes in explanation of this phrase
ἐπ’ αὐτομολίας προφάσει ἀπέρχονται: but I cannot think that any of
them are successful. There are even some who despair of success
so much, as to wish to change αὐτομολίας by conjecture; see the
citations in Poppo’s long note.
</p>
<p>
But surely the literal sense of the words is here both defensible
and instructive: “Some of them depart under pretence (or profession)
of being deserters to the enemy.” All the commentators reject this
meaning, because they say, it is absurd to talk of a man’s announcing
beforehand that he intends to desert to the enemy, and giving <i>that</i>
as an excuse for quitting the camp. Such is not, in my judgment, the
meaning of the word προφάσει here. It does not denote what a man
said <i>before</i> he quitted the Athenian camp, he would of course say
nothing of his intention to any one, but the color which he would
put upon his conduct <i>after he got within</i> the Syracusan lines.
He would present himself to them as a deserter to their cause;
he would profess anxiety to take part in the defence; he would
pretend to be tired of the oppressive Athenian dominion; for it is
to be recollected, that all or most of these deserters were men
belonging to the subject-allies of Athens. Those who passed over to
the Syracusan lines would naturally recommend themselves by making
profession of such dispositions, even though they did not really
feel any such; for their real reason was, that the Athenian service
had now become irksome, unprofitable, and dangerous; and the easiest
manner of getting away from it was, to pass over as a deserter to
Syracuse.
</p>
<p>
Nikias distinguishes these men from others, “who got away, as they
could find opportunity, to some part or other of Sicily.” These
latter also would of course keep their intention of departing secret,
until they got safe away into some Sicilian town; but when once
there, they would make no profession of any feeling which they did
not entertain. If they said anything, they would tell the plain
truth, that they were making their escape from a position which now
gave them more trouble than profit.
</p>
<p>
It appears to me that the words ἐπ’ αὐτομολίας προφάσει will bear
this sense perfectly well, and that it is the real meaning of Nikias.
</p>
<p>
Even before the Peloponnesian war was begun, the Corinthian envoy at
Sparta affirms that the Athenians cannot depend upon their seamen
standing true to them, since their navy was manned with hired foreign
seamen rather than with natives—ὠνητὴ γὰρ ἡ Ἀθηναίων δύναμις μᾶλλον
ἢ οἰκεία (Thucyd. i, 121). The statement of Nikias proves that this
remark was to a great extent well founded.</p>

</p>
<p>
I agree with Dr. Arnold and other commentators in thinking that the
money taken out by Eurymedon was far more probably the larger sum of
the two, than the smaller. The former reading seems to deserve the
preference. Besides, Diodorus states that Eurymedon took out with him
one hundred and forty talents: his authority, indeed, does not count
for much, but it counts for something, in coincidence with a certain
force of intrinsic probability (Diodor. xiii, 8).

On an occasion such as this, to send a very small sum, such as twenty
talents, would produce a discouraging effect upon the armament.</p>

of Nikias.

</p>
<p>
The meaning of this passage appears quite unambiguous, that Eurymedon
had been sent to Sicily in the winter, to carry the sum of one
hundred and twenty talents to Nikias, and was now on his return (see
Thucyd. vii, 11). Nor is it without some astonishment that I read in
Mr. Mitford: “At Anactorium, Demosthenês found Eurymedon <i>collecting
provisions</i> for Sicily,” etc. Mr. Mitford then says in a note
(quoting the Scholiast, Ἤτοι τὰ πρὸς τροφὴν χρήσιμα, καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ
συντείνοντα αὐτοῖς, Schol.): “This is not the only occasion on which
Thucydidês uses the term χρήματα for <i>necessaries in general</i>. Smith
has translated accordingly: but the Latin has <i>pecuniam</i>, which does
not express the sense intended here,” (ch. xviii, sect. vi, vol. iv,
p. 118.)
</p>
<p>
There cannot be the least doubt that the Latin is here right. The
definite article makes the point quite certain, even if it were true
(which I doubt) that Thucydidês sometimes uses the word χρήματα to
mean “necessaries in general.” I doubt still more whether he ever
uses ἄγων in the sense of “collecting.”</p>

It appears as if the ἀντηρίδες or sustaining beams were something
new, now provided for the first time, in order to strengthen the
epôtid and render it fit to drive in collision against the enemy.

ἀντηρίδες, are to me very obscure, nor do I think that any of the

</p>
<p>
Dr. Arnold and Göller both interpret this description of Thucydidês
(see their notes on this chapter, and Dr. Arnold’s Appendix, p. 275)
as if Nikias, immediately that the Syracusan counter-wall had crossed
his blockading line, had evacuated his circle and works on the slope
of Epipolæ, and had retired down exclusively into the lower ground
below. Dr. Thirlwall too is of the same opinion (Hist. Gr. vol. iii,
ch. xxvi, pp. 432-434).
</p>
<p>
This appears to me unauthorized and incorrect. What conceivable
motive can be assigned to induce Nikias to yield up to the enemy so
important an advantage? If he had once relinquished the slope of
Epipolæ, to occupy exclusively the marsh beneath the southern cliff,
Gylippus and the Syracusans would have taken good care that he should
never again have mounted that cliff; nor could he ever have got
near to the παρατείχισμα. The moment when the Athenians did at last
abandon their fortifications on the slope of Epipolæ (τὰ ἀνω τείχη)
is specially marked by Thucydidês afterwards, vii, 60: it was at the
last moment of desperation, when the service of all was needed for
the final maritime battle in the Great Harbor. Dr. Arnold (p. 275)
misinterprets this passage, in my judgment, evading the direct sense
of it.
</p>
<p>
The words of Thucydidês, vii, 42—εἰ ἐπικρατήσειέ τις τῶν τε Ἐπιπολῶν
τῆς ἀναβάσεως, καὶ αὖθις τοῦ ἐν αὐταῖς στρατοπέδου—are more correctly
conceived by M. Firmin Didot, in the note to his translation,
than by Arnold and Göller. The στρατόπεδον here indicated does
<i>not</i> mean the Athenian circle, and their partially completed line
of circumvallation on the slope of Epipolæ. It means the ground
higher up than this, which they had partially occupied at first
while building the fort of Labdalum, and of which they had been
substantially masters until the arrival of Gylippus who had now
converted it into a camp or στρατόπεδον of the Syracusans.</p>

It seems probable that some of the taxiarchs and trierarchs were
present at this deliberation, as we find in another case afterwards,
c. 60. Possibly, Demosthenês might even desire that they <i>should</i> be
present, as witnesses respecting the feeling of the army; and also as
supporters, if the matter came afterwards to be debated in the public
assembly at Athens. It is to this fact that the words ἐμφανῶς μετὰ

The insignificance of the party in Syracuse which corresponded with
Nikias may be reasonably inferred from Thucyd. vii, 55. It consisted
in part of those Leontines who had been incorporated into the
Syracusan citizenship (Diodor. xiii, 18).
</p>
<p>
Polyænus (i, 43, 1) has a tale respecting a revolt of the slaves
or villeins (οἰκέται) at Syracuse during the Athenian siege, under
a leader named Sosikratês, a revolt suppressed by the stratagem
of Hermokratês. That various attempts of this sort took place at
Syracuse during these two trying years, is by no means improbable. In
fact, it is difficult to understand how the numerous predial slaves
were kept in order during the great pressure and danger, prior to the
coming of Gylippus.</p>

Thucydidês states that Nikias adopted the injunction of the prophets,
to tarry <i>thrice nine</i> days (vii, 50). Diodorus says <i>three</i> days.
Plutarch intimates that Nikias went beyond the injunction of the
prophets, who only insisted on <i>three</i> days, while he resolved on
remaining for an entire lunar period (Plutarch, Nikias, c. 23).
</p>
<p>
I follow the statement of Thucydidês: there is no reason to believe
that Nikias would lengthen the time beyond what the prophets
prescribed.

Dr. Arnold (together with Göller and Poppo), following the Scholiast,
explain these words as having particular reference to the metics in
the Athenian naval service. But I cannot think this correct. All
persons in that service—who were freemen, but yet not citizens of
Athens—are here designated; partly metics, doubtless, but partly also
citizens of the islands and dependent allies,—the ξένοι ναυβάται
alluded to by the Corinthians and by Periklês at the beginning of the
Peloponnesian war (Thucyd. i, 121-143) as the ὠνητὴ δύναμις μᾶλλον ἢ
οἰκεία of Athens. Without doubt there were numerous foreign seamen
in the warlike navy of Athens, who derived great consideration as
well as profit from the service, and often passed themselves off for
Athenian citizens when they really were not so.</p>

confused one battle with the other, for his account can hardly be
made to harmonize with Thucydidês (Plutarch, Nikias, c. 24).
</p>
<p>
It is to be recollected that both Plutarch and Diodorus had probably
read the description of the battles in the Great Harbor of Syracuse,
contained in Philistus; a better witness, if we had his account
before us, even than Thucydidês; since he was probably at this time
in Syracuse and was perhaps actually engaged.</p>

by a lighter ship to avoid direct collision against a heavier, is
strikingly illustrated by a passage in Plutarch’s Life of Lucullus,
where a naval engagement between the Roman general, and Neoptolemus
the admiral of Mithridates, is described. “Lucullus was on board a
Rhodian quinquerime, commanded by Damagoras, a skilful Rhodian pilot;
while Neoptolemus was approaching with a ship much heavier, and
driving forward to a direct collision: upon which Damagoras evaded
the blow, rowed rapidly round, and struck the enemy in the stern.”

ἀνεπίφθονα. <em class="gesperrt">Ἀνθ’ ὧν ἡ μὲν ἐλπὶς ὅμως θρασεῖα τοῦ
μέλλοντος, αἱ δὲ ξυμφοραὶ οὐ κατ’ ἀξίαν δὴ φοβοῦσι</em>. Τάχα δ’ ἂν
καὶ λωφήσειαν· ἱκανὰ γὰρ τοῖς τε πολεμίοις εὐτύχηται, καὶ εἴ τῳ θεῶν
ἐπίφθονοι ἐστρατεύσαμεν, ἀρκούντως ἤδη τετιμωρήμεθα.</p>

<p>I have translated the words οὐ κατ’ ἀξίαν, and the sentence of
which they form a part, differently from what has been hitherto
sanctioned by the commentators, who construe κατ’ ἀξίαν as meaning
“according to our desert,” understand the words αἱ ξυμφοραὶ οὐ κατ’
ἀξίαν as bearing the same sense with the words ταῖς παρὰ τὴν ἀξίαν
κακοπραγίαις some lines before; and likewise construe οὐ, not with
φοβοῦσι, but with κατ’ ἀξίαν, assigning to φοβοῦσι an affirmative
sense. They translate: “Quare, <i>quamvis nostra fortuna, prorsus
afflicta videatur</i> (these words have no parallel in the original)
rerum tamen futurarum spes est audax: sed clades, quas nullo nostro
merito accepimus, <i>nos</i> jam terrent. At fortasse cessabunt,” etc. M.
Didot translates: “Aussi j’ai un ferme espoir dans l’avenir, <i>malgré
l’effroi</i> que des <i>malheurs non mérités</i> nous causent.” Dr. Arnold
passes the sentence over without notice.</p>

<p>This manner of translating appears to me not less unsuitable in
reference to the spirit and thread of the harangue, than awkward as
regards the individual words. Looking to the spirit of the harangue,
the object of encouraging the dejected soldiers would hardly be
much answered by repeating—what in fact had been glanced at in a
manner sufficient and becoming, before—that “the unmerited reverses
terrified either Nikias or the soldiers.” Then as to the words;
the expressions ἀνθ’ ὧν, ὅμως, μὲν, and δὲ, seem to me to denote,
not only that the two halves of the sentence apply both of them to
Nikias, but that the first half of the sentence is in harmony, not in
opposition, with the second. Matthiæ (in my judgment, erroneously)
refers (Gr. Gr. § 623) ὅμως to some words which have preceded; I
think that ὅμως contributes to hold together the first and the
second affirmation of the sentence. Now the Latin translation refers
the first half of the sentence to Nikias, and the last half to the
soldiers whom he addresses; while the translation of M. Didot, by
means of the word <i>malgré</i>, for which there is nothing corresponding
in the Greek, puts the second half in antithesis to the first.</p>

<p>I cannot but think that οὐ ought to be construed with φοβοῦσι,
and that the words κατ’ ἀξίαν do not bear the meaning assigned to
them by the translators. Ἀξίαν not only means, “<i>desert</i>, merit,
the title to that which a man has earned by his conduct,” as in the
previous phrase παρὰ τὴν ἀξίαν, but it also means, “price, value,
title to be cared for, capacity of exciting more or less desire or
aversion,” in which last sense it is predicated as an attribute, not
only of moral beings, but of other objects besides. Thus Aristotle
says (Ethic. Nikom. iii, 11): ὁ γὰρ οὕτως ἔχων μᾶλλον ἀγαπᾷ τὰς
τοιαύτας <em class="gesperrt">ἡδονὰς τῆς ἀξίας</em>· ὁ δὲ σώφρων οὐ
τοιοῦτος, etc. Again, ibid. iii, 5. Ὁ μὲν οὖν ἃ δεῖ καὶ οὖ ἕνεκα,
ὑπομένων καὶ φοβούμενος, καὶ ὡς δεῖ, καὶ ὅτε, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ θαῤῥῶν,
ἀνδρεῖος· <em class="gesperrt">κατ’ ἀξίαν</em> γὰρ, καὶ ὡς ἂν ὁ
λόγος, πάσχει καὶ πράττει ὁ ἀνδρεῖος. Again, ibid. iv, 2. Διὰ τοῦτό
ἐστι τοῦ μεγαλοπρεποῦς, ἐν ᾧ ἂν ποιῇ γένει, μεγαλοπρεπῶς ποιεῖν· τὸ
γὰρ τοιοῦτον οὐκ εὐυπέρβλητον, καὶ ἔχον <em class="gesperrt">κατ’
ἀξίαν</em> τοῦ δαπανήματος. Again, ibid. viii, 14. Ἀχρεῖον γὰρ ὄντα
οὔ φασι δεῖν ἴσον ἔχειν· λειτουργίαν τε γὰρ γίνεσθαι, καὶ οὐ φιλίαν,
εἰ μὴ <em class="gesperrt">κατ’ ἀξίαν</em> τῶν ἔργων ἔσται τὰ ἐκ τῆς
φιλίας. Compare also ib. viii, 13.</p>

<p>Xenophon, Cyrop. viii, 4, 32. τὸ γὰρ πολλὰ δοκοῦντα ἔχειν μὴ <em
class="gesperrt">κατ’ ἀξίαν</em> τῆς οὐσίας φαίνεσθαι ὠφελοῦντα τοὺς
φίλους, ἀνελευθερίαν ἐμοίγε δοκεῖ περιάπτειν. Compare Xenophon,
Memorab. ii, 5, 2. ὥσπερ τῶν οἰκετῶν, οὕτω καὶ τῶν φίλων, εἰσὶν <em
class="gesperrt">ἀξίαι</em>; also ibid. i, 6, 11, and Isokratês,
cont. Lochit. Or. xx, s. 8.</p>

<p>The words κατ’ ἀξίαν in Thucydidês appear to me to bear the
same meaning as in these passages of Xenophon and Aristotle, “in
proportion to their value,” or to their real magnitude. If we so
construe them, the words ἀνθ’ ὧν, ὅμως, μὲν, and δὲ, all fall into
their proper order: the whole sentence after ἀνθ’ ὧν applies to
Nikias personally, is a corollary from what he had asserted before,
and forms a suitable point in an harangue for encouraging his
dispirited soldiers: “Look how <i>I</i> bear up, who have as much cause
for mourning as any of you. I have behaved well both towards gods
and towards men: in return for which, I am comparatively comfortable
both as to the future and as to the present: as to the future, I
have strong hopes; at the same time that, as to the present, I am
not overwhelmed by the present misfortunes in proportion to their
prodigious intensity.”</p>

<p>This is the precise thing for a man of resolution to say upon so
terrible an occasion.</p>

<p>The particle δὴ has its appropriate meaning, αἱ δὲ ξυμφοραὶ οὐ
κατ’ ἀξίαν <em class="gesperrt">δὴ</em> φοβοῦσι; “and the present
distresses, though they do appall me, do not appall me <i>assuredly</i>
in proportion to their actual magnitude.” Lastly, the particle καὶ
(in the succeeding phrase, τάχα δ’ ἂν <em class="gesperrt">καὶ</em>
λωφήσειαν) does not fit on to the preceding passage as usually
construed: accordingly the Latin translator, as well as M. Didot,
leave it out, and translate: “At fortasse cessabunt.” “Mais peut-être
vont-ils cesser.” It ought to be translated: “And perhaps they may
<i>even</i> abate,” which implies that what had been asserted in the
preceding sentence is here intended not to be contradicted, but to
be carried forward and strengthened: see Kühner, Griech. Gramm.
sects. 725-728. Such would not be the case as the sentence is usually
construed.</p>

This is a remarkable illustration of the doctrine, so frequently
set forth in Herodotus, that the gods were jealous of any man or
any nation who was preëminently powerful, fortunate, or prosperous.
Nikias, recollecting the immense manifestation and promise with which
his armament had started from Peiræus, now believed that this had
provoked the jealousy of some of the gods, and brought about the
misfortunes in Sicily. He comforts his soldiers by saying that the
enemy is now at the same dangerous pinnacle of exaltation, whilst
<i>they</i> have exhausted the sad effects of the divine jealousy.

<p id="Footnote_506"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_506">[506]</a></span> Dr. Arnold (Thucyd. vol. iii, p. 280, copied by
Göller, ad vii, 81) thinks that the division of Demosthenês
reached and passed the river Kakyparis; and was captured between
the Kakyparis and the Erineus. But the words of Thucyd. vii, 80,
81, do not sustain this. The division of Nikias was in advance of
Demosthenês from the beginning, and gained upon it principally
during the early part of the march, before daybreak; because it was
then that the disorder of the division of Demosthenês was the most
inconvenient: see c. 81—ὡς τῆς νυκτὸς τότε ξυνεταράχθησαν, etc. When
Thucydidês, therefore, says, that “at daybreak <i>they</i> arrived at
the sea,” (ἅμα δὲ τῇ ἕῳ ἀφικνοῦνται ἐς τὴν θάλατταν, c. 80,) this
cannot be true <i>both</i> of Nikias and of Demosthenês. If the former
arrived there at daybreak, the latter cannot have come to the same
point till some time after daybreak. Nikias must have been beforehand
with Demosthenês when he reached the sea, and considerably <i>more</i>
beforehand when he reached the Kakyparis: moreover, we are expressly
told that Nikias did not wait for his colleague, that he thought it
for the best to get on as fast as possible with his own division.
</p>
<p>
It appears to me that the words ἀφικνοῦνται, etc. (c. 80), are not
to be understood both of Nikias and Demosthenês, but that they
refer back to the word αὐτοῖς, two or three lines behind: “the
<i>Athenians (taken generally)</i> reached the sea,” no attention being
at that moment paid to the difference between the front and the rear
divisions. The <i>Athenians</i> might be said, not improperly, to reach
the sea, at the time when the division of Nikias reached it.</p>

Συρακοσίους διώκοντας οὐ προὐχώρει μᾶλλον ἢ ἐς μάχην ξυνετάσσετο, ἕως
ἐνδιατρίβων κυκλοῦταί τε ὑπ’ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν πολλῷ θορύβῳ αὐτός τε καὶ

</p>
<p>
I translate ὁδὸς δὲ ἔνθεν τε καὶ ἔνθεν differently from Dr. Arnold,
from Mitford, and from others. These words are commonly understood to
mean that this walled plantation was bordered by two roads, one on
each side. Certainly the words <i>might</i> have that signification; but I
think they also may have the signification (compare ii, 76) which I
have given in the text, and which seems more plausible. It certainly
is very improbable that the Athenians should have gone out of the
road, in order to shelter themselves in the plantation; since they
were fully aware that there was no safety for them except in getting
away. If we suppose that the plantation lay exactly in the road, the
word ἀνειληθέντες becomes perfectly explicable, on which I do not
think that Dr. Arnold’s comment is satisfactory. The pressure of the
troops from the rear into the hither opening, while those in the
front could not get out by the farther opening, would naturally cause
this crowd and <i>huddling</i> inside. A road which passed right through
the walled ground, entering at one side and coming out at the other,
might well be called ὁδὸς δὲ ἔνθεν τε καὶ ἔνθεν. Compare Dr. Arnold’s
Remarks on the Map of Syracuse, vol. iii, p. 281; as well as his note
on vii, 81.
</p>
<p>
I imagine the olive-trees to be here named, not for either of the
two reasons mentioned by Dr. Arnold, but because they hindered
the Athenians from seeing beforehand distinctly the nature of the
inclosure into which they were hastening, and therefore prevented any
precautions from being taken, such as that of forbidding too many
troops from entering at once, etc.</p>

orations purporting to have been held in the Syracusan assembly, in
discussing how the prisoners were to be dealt with. An old citizen,
named Nikolaus, who has lost his two sons in the war, is made to
advocate the side of humane treatment; while Gylippus is introduced
as the orator recommending harshness and revenge.
</p>
<p>
From whom Diodorus borrowed this, I do not know; but his whole
account of the matter appears to me untrustworthy.
</p>
<p>
One may judge of his accuracy when one finds him stating that the
prisoners received each two <i>chœnikes</i> of barley-meal, instead of two
<i>kotylæ</i>; the chœnix being four times as much as the kotylê (Diodor.
xiii, 19).</p>

statement which Plutarch here cites from Timæus respecting the
intervention of Hermokratês, is not in any substantial contradiction
with Philistus and Thucydidês. The word κελευσθέντας seems decidedly
preferable to καταλευσθέντας, in the text of Plutarch.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_524"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_524">[524]</a></span> Plutarch, Nikias, c. 28. Though Plutarch says that
the month Karneius is “that which the Athenians call Metageitnion,”
yet it is not safe to affirm that the day of the slaughter of the
Asinarus was the 16th of the Attic month Metageitnion. We know
that the civil months of different cities seldom or never exactly
coincided. See the remarks of Franz on this point, in his comment on
the valuable Inscriptions of Tauromenium, Corp. Inscr. Gr. No. 5640,
part xxxii, sect 3, p. 640.
</p>
<p>
The surrender of Nikias must have taken place, I think, not less than
twenty-four or twenty-five days after the eclipse, which occurred on
the 27th of August, that is, about Sept. 21. Mr. Fynes Clinton (F.
H. ad ann. 413 <small>B.C.</small>) seems to me to compress too much the
interval between the eclipse and the retreat; considering that that
interval included two great battles, with a certain delay before,
between, and after.
</p>
<p>
The μετόπωρον noticed by Thucyd. vii, 79. suits with Sept. 21:

</p>
<p>
Justin erroneously says that Demosthenês actually did kill himself,
rather than submit to surrender, before the surrender of Nikias; who,
he says, did not choose to follow the example:—
</p>
<p>
“Demosthenês, amisso exercitu a captivitate gladio et voluntariâ
morte se vindicat: Nicias autem, ne Demosthenis quidem exemplo,
ut sibi consuleret, admonitus, cladem suorum auxit dedecore
captivitatis.” (Justin, iv, 5.)
</p>
<p>
Philistus, whom Pausanias announces himself as following, is an
excellent witness for the actual facts in Sicily; though not so good
a witness for the impression at Athens respecting those facts.
</p>
<p>
It seems certain, even from Thucydidês, that Nikias, in surrendering
himself to Gylippus, thought that he had considerable chance of
saving his life, Plutarch too so interprets the proceeding, and
condemns it as disgraceful, see his comparison of Nikias and Crassus,
near the end. Demosthenês could not have thought the same for
himself: the fact of his attempted suicide appears to me certain, on
the authority of Philistus, though Thucydidês does not notice it.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

</p>
<p>
So stood the text of Thucydidês, until various recent editors changed
the last words, on the authority of some MSS., to <em class="gesperrt">διὰ τὴν πᾶσαν ἐς
ἀρετὴν νενομισμένην ἐπιτήδευσιν</em>.
</p>
<p>
Though Dr. Arnold and some of the best critics prefer and adopt the
latter reading, I confess it seems to me that the former is more
suitable to the Greek vein of thought, as well as more conformable to
truth about Nikias.
</p>
<p>
A man’s good or bad fortune, depending on the favorable or
unfavorable disposition of the gods towards him, was understood to
be determined more directly by his piety and religious observances,
rather than by his virtue, see passages in Isokratês de Permutation.
Orat. xv, sect. 301; Lysias, cont. Nikomach. c. 5, p. 854, though
undoubtedly the two ideas went to a certain extent together. Men
might differ about the virtue of Nikias; but his piety was an
incontestable fact; and his “good fortune” also, in times prior to
the Sicilian expedition, was recognized by men like Alkibiadês,
who most probably had no very lofty opinion of his virtue (Thucyd.
vi, 17). The contrast between the remarkable piety of Nikias, and
that extremity of ill-fortune which marked the close of his life,
was very likely to shock Grecian ideas generally, and was a natural
circumstance for the historian to note. Whereas if we read, in the
passage, πᾶσαν ἐς ἀρετὴν, the panegyric upon Nikias becomes both
less special and more disproportionate, beyond what even Thucydidês
(as far as we can infer from other expressions, see v, 16) would
be inclined to bestow upon him—more, in fact, than he says in
commendation even of Periklês.</p>

those of the rapacious and unprincipled Crassus, with whom Plutarch
compares the latter:—
</p>
<p>
“Vetus in familiâ nobilitas, magnæ opes: ipsi medium ingenium,
magis extra vitia, quam cum virtutibus. Sed claritas natalium, et
metus temporum, obtentui fuit, ut <i>quod segnitia fuit, sapientia</i>

An inscription preserved in M. Boeckh’s Corp. Inscr. (part ii, No.

lets a farm to a certain tenant for forty years, at a fixed rent of
one hundred and forty drachmæ; but if an invading enemy shall drive
him out or injure his farm, the deme is to receive one half of the
year’s produce, in place of the year’s rent.</p>

<p id="Footnote_534"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_534">[534]</a></span> Upon this new assessment on the allies, determined by
the Athenians, Mr. Mitford remarks as follows:—
</p>
<p>
“Thus light, in comparison of what we have laid upon ourselves,
was the heaviest tax, as far as we learn from history, at that
time known in the world. Yet it caused much discontent among the
dependent commonwealths; the arbitrary power by which it was imposed
being indeed reasonably execrated, though the burden itself was
comparatively a nothing.”
</p>
<p>
This admission is not easily reconciled with the frequent invectives
in which Mr. Mitford indulges against the empire of Athens, as
practising a system of extortion and oppression ruinous to the
subject-allies.
</p>
<p>
I do not know, however, on what authority he affirms that this was
“the heaviest tax then known in the world;” and that “it caused much
discontent among the subject commonwealths.” The latter assertion
would indeed be sufficiently probable, if it be true that the tax
ever came into operation; but we are not entitled to affirm it.
</p>
<p>
Considering how very soon the terrible misfortunes of Athens came
on, I cannot but think it a matter of uncertainty whether the new
assessment ever became a reality throughout the Athenian empire. And
the fact that Thucydidês does not notice it as an additional cause of
discontent among the allies, is one reason for such doubts.</p>

</p>
<p>
From these latter words, it would seem that Thucydidês considered
the Athenians, after having adopted the expedition by their votes,
to have debarred themselves from the right of complaining of those
speakers who had stood forward prominently to advise the step. I
do not at all concur in his opinion. The adviser of any important
measure always makes himself morally responsible for its justice,
usefulness, and practicability; and he very properly incurs disgrace,
more or less according to the case, if it turns out to present
results totally contrary to those which he had predicted. We know
that the Athenian law often imposed upon the mover of a proposition
not merely <i>moral</i>, but even <i>legal</i>, responsibility; a regulation of
doubtful propriety under other circumstances, but which I believe to
have been useful at Athens.
</p>
<p>
It must be admitted, however, to have been hard upon the advisers of
this expedition, that—from the total destruction of the armament,
neither generals nor soldiers returning—they were not enabled to
show how much of the ruin had arisen from faults in the execution,
not in the plan conceived. The speaker in the Oration of Lysias—περὶ
δημεύσεως τοῦ Νικίου ἀδελφοῦ (Or. xviii, sect. 2)—attempts to
transfer the blame from Nikias upon the advisers of the expedition, a
manifest injustice.
</p>
<p>
Demosthenês (in the Oration De Coronâ, c. 73) gives an emphatic and
noble statement of the responsibility which he cheerfully accepts
for himself as a political speaker and adviser; responsibility for
seeing the beginnings and understanding the premonitory signs of
coming events, and giving his countrymen warning beforehand: ἰδεῖν τὰ
πράγματα ἀρχόμενα καὶ προαισθέσθαι καὶ προειπεῖν τοῖς ἄλλοις. This
is the just view of the subject; and, applying the measure proposed
by Demosthenês, the Athenians had ample ground to be displeased with
their orators.</p>

</p>
<p>
Upon which Dr. Arnold remarks: “That is, no measure was to be
submitted to the people, till it had first been approved by this
council of elders.” And such is the general view of the commentators.
</p>
<p>
No such meaning as this, however, is necessarily contained in
the word Πρόβουλοι. It is, indeed, conceivable that persons so
denominated might be invested with such a control; but we cannot
infer it, or affirm it, simply from the name. Nor will the passages
in Aristotle’s Politics, wherein the word Πρόβουλοι occurs, authorize
any inference with respect to this Board in the special case of
Athens (Aristotel. Politic. iv, 11, 9; iv, 12, 8; vi, 5, 10-13).
</p>
<p>
The Board only seems to have lasted for a short time at Athens, being
named for a temporary purpose, at a moment of peculiar pressure and
discouragement. During such a state of feeling, there was little
necessity for throwing additional obstacles in the way of new
propositions to be made to the people. It was rather of importance
to <i>encourage</i> the suggestion of new measures, from men of sense and
experience. A Board destined merely for control and hindrance, would
have been mischievous instead of useful under the reigning melancholy
at Athens.
</p>
<p>
The Board was doubtless merged in the Oligarchy of Four Hundred, like
all the other magistracies of the state, and was not reconstituted
after their deposition.
</p>
<p>
I cannot think it admissible to draw inferences as to the functions
of this Board of Probûli now constituted, from the proceedings of
the Probûlus in Aristophanis Lysistrata, as is done by Wachsmuth
(Hellenische Alterthumskunde, i, 2, p. 198), and by Wattenbach (De
Quadringentorum Athenis Factione, pp. 17-21, Berlin 1842).
</p>
<p>
Schömann (Ant. Jur. Pub. Græcor. v, xii, p. 181) says of these
Πρόβουλοι: “Videtur autem eorum potestas fere annua fuisse.” I do
not distinctly understand what he means by these words; whether he
means that the Board continued permanent, but that the members were
annually changed. If this be his meaning, I dissent from it. I think
that the Board lasted until the time of the Four Hundred, which would
be about a year and a half after its first institution.</p>

<p>
The language of Thucydidês in this passage deserves notice. The
Athenians were now at enmity with Corinth: it was therefore
remarkable, and contrary to what would be expected among Greeks, that
they should be present with their theôry, or solemn sacrifice, at the
Isthmian festival. Accordingly Thucydidês, when he mentions that they
went thither, thinks it right to add the explanation—<em class="gesperrt">ἐπηγγέλθησαν
γὰρ</em>—“for they had been invited;” “for the festival truce had
been formally signified to them.” That the heralds who proclaimed
the truce should come and proclaim it to a state in hostility
with Corinth, was something unusual, and merited special notice:
otherwise, Thucydidês would never have thought it worth while to
mention the proclamation, it being the uniform practice.
</p>
<p>
We must recollect that this was the first Isthmian festival which
had taken place since the resumption of the war between Athens and
the Peloponnesian alliance. The habit of leaving out Athens from the
Corinthian herald’s proclamation had not yet been renewed. In regard
to the Isthmian festival, there was probably greater reluctance to
leave her out, because that festival was in its origin half Athenian;
said to have been established, or revived after interruption, by
Theseus; and the Athenian theôry enjoyed a προεδρία, or privileged
place, at the games (Plutarch, Theseus, c. 25; Argument. ad Pindar.
Isthm. Schol.).</p>

Thucyd. viii, 21. The dispositions and plans of the
“higher people” at Samos, to call in the Peloponnesians and revolt
from Athens, are fully admitted even by Mr. Mitford, and implied by
Dr. Thirlwall, who argues that the government of Samos cannot have
been oligarchical, because, if it had been so, the island would
already have revolted from Athens to the Peloponnesians.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Mitford says (ch. xix, sect. iii, vol. iv, p. 191): “Meanwhile
the body of the higher people at Samos, more depressed than all
others since their reduction on their former revolt, were <i>proposing
to seize the opportunity that seemed to offer through the prevalence
of the Peloponnesian arms, of mending their condition</i>. The lower
people, <i>having intelligence of their design</i>, rose upon them, and,
with the assistance of the crews of three Athenian ships then at
Samos, overpowered them,” etc. etc. etc.
</p>
<p>
“The <i>massacre and robbery</i> were rewarded by a decree of the Athenian
people, granting to the perpetrators the independent administration
of the affairs of their island; which, since the last rebellion, had
been kept <i>under the immediate control of the Athenian government</i>.”
</p>
<p>
To call this a <i>massacre</i> is perversion of language. It was an
insurrection and intestine conflict, in which the “higher people”
were vanquished, but of which they also were the beginners, by their
conspiracy—which Mr. Mitford himself admits as a fact—to introduce
a foreign enemy into the island. Does he imagine that the “lower
people” were bound to sit still and see this done? And what means
had they of preventing it, except by insurrection; which inevitably
became bloody, because the “higher people” were a strong party,
in possession of the powers of government, with great means of
resistance. The loss on the part of the assailants is not made known
to us, nor indeed the loss in so far as it fell on the followers of
the geômori. Thucydidês specifies only the number of the geômori
themselves, who were persons of individual importance.
</p>
<p>
I do not clearly understand what idea Mr. Mitford forms to himself
of the government of Samos at this time. He seems to conceive it as
democratical, yet under great immediate control from Athens, and
that it kept the “higher people” in a state of severe depression,
from which they sought to relieve themselves by the aid of the
Peloponnesian arms.
</p>
<p>
But if he means by the expression, “<i>under the immediate control of
the Athenian government</i>,” that there was any Athenian governor or
garrison at Samos, the account here given by Thucydidês distinctly
refutes him. The conflict was between two intestine parties, “the
higher people and the lower people.” The only Athenians who took part
in it were the crews of three triremes, and even they were there by
accident (οἳ ἔτυχον παρόντες), not as a regular garrison. Samos was
under an indigenous government; but it was a subject and tributary
ally of Athens, like all the other allies, with the exception of
Chios and Methymna (Thucyd. vi, 85). After this resolution, the
Athenians raised it to the rank of an autonomous ally, which Mr.
Mitford is pleased to call “rewarding massacre and robbery,” in the
language of a party orator rather than of an historian.
</p>
<p>
But was the government of Samos, immediately before this intestine
contest, oligarchical or democratical? The language of Thucydidês
carries to my mind a full conviction that it was oligarchical, under
an exclusive aristocracy, called The Geômori. Dr. Thirlwall, however
(whose candid and equitable narrative of this event forms a striking
contrast to that of Mr. Mitford), is of a different opinion. He
thinks it certain that a democratical government had been established
at Samos by the Athenians, when it was reconquered by them
(<small>B.C.</small> 440) after its revolt. That the government continued
democratical during the first years of the Peloponnesian war, he
conceives to be proved by the hostility of the Samian exiles at Anæa,
whom he looks upon as oligarchical refugees. And though not agreeing
in Mr. Mitford’s view of the peculiarly depressed condition of the
“higher people” at Samos at this later time, he nevertheless thinks
that they were not actually in possession of the government. “Still
(he says), as the island gradually recovered its prosperity, the
privileged class seems also to have looked upward, perhaps contrived
to regain a part of the substance of power under different forms,
and probably betrayed a strong inclination to revive its ancient
pretensions on the first opportunity. <i>That it had not yet advanced
beyond this point, may be regarded as certain; because otherwise
Samos would have been among the foremost to revolt from Athens</i>: and
on the other hand, it is no less clear, that the state of parties
there was such as to excite a high degree of mutual jealousy, and
great alarm in the Athenians, to whom the loss of the island at this
juncture would have been almost irreparable.” (Hist. of Gr. ch.
xxvii, vol. iii, p. 477 2d edit.) Manso (Sparta, book iv, vol. ii, p.
266) is of the same opinion.
</p>
<p>
Surely, the conclusion which Dr. Thirlwall here announces as certain,
cannot be held to rest on adequate premises. Admitting that there was
an oligarchy in power at Samos, it is perfectly possible to explain
why this oligarchy had not yet carried into act its disposition to
revolt from Athens. We see that none of the allies of Athens—not
even Chios, the most powerful of all—revolted without the extraneous
pressure and encouragement of a foreign fleet. Alkibiadês, after
securing Chios, considered Milêtus to be next in order of importance,
and had, moreover, peculiar connections with the leading men
there (viii, 17); so that he went next to detach that place from
Athens. Milêtus, being on the continent, placed him in immediate
communication with Tissaphernês, for which reason he might naturally
deem it of importance superior even to Samos in his plans. Moreover,
not only no foreign fleet had yet reached Samos, but several Athenian
ships had arrived there: for Strombichidês, having come across the
Ægean too late to save Chios, made Samos a sort of central station
(viii, 16). These circumstances combined with the known reluctance of
the Samian demos, or commonalty, are surely sufficient to explain why
the Samian oligarchy had not yet consummated its designs to revolt.
And hence the fact, that no revolt had yet taken place, cannot be
held to warrant Dr. Thirlwall’s inference, that the government was
<i>not</i> oligarchical.
</p>
<p>
We have no information how or when the oligarchical government at
Samos got up. That the Samian refugees at Anæa, so actively hostile
to Samos and Athens during the first ten years of the Peloponnesian
war, were oligarchical exiles acting against a democratical
government at Samos (iv, 75), is not in itself improbable; yet it
is not positively stated. The government of Samos might have been,
even at that time, oligarchical; yet, if it acted in the Athenian
interest, there would doubtless be a body of exiles watching for
opportunities of injuring it, by aid of the enemies of Athens.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, it seems to me, that if we read and put together the
passages of Thucydidês, viii, 21, 63, 73, it is impossible without
the greatest violence to put any other sense upon them, except as
meaning that the government of Samos was now in the hands of the
oligarchy, or geômori, and that the Demos rose in insurrection
against them, with ultimate triumph. The natural sense of the words
ἐπανάστασις, ἐπανίσταμαι, is that of <i>insurrection against an
established government: it does not mean, “a violent attack by one
party upon another;” still less does it mean, “an attack made by a
party in possession of the government:</i>” which nevertheless it ought
to mean, if Dr. Thirlwall be correct in supposing that the Samian
government was now democratical. Thus we have, in the description of
the Samian revolt from Athens—Thucyd. i, 115 (after Thucydidês has
stated that the Athenians established a democratical government, he
next says that the Samian exiles presently came over with a mercenary
force)—καὶ πρῶτον μὲν τῷ <em class="gesperrt">δήμῳ ἐπανέστησαν</em>, καὶ ἐκράτησαν τῶν
πλείστων, etc. Again, v, 23—about the apprehended insurrection of
the Helots against the Spartans—ἢν δὲ ἡ δούλεια <em class="gesperrt">ἐπανίστηται</em>:
compare Xenoph. Hellen. v, 4, 19; Plato, Republ. iv, 18, p. 444;
Herodot. iii, 39-120. So also δυνατοὶ is among the words which
Thucydidês uses for an oligarchical party, either in government or
in what may be called <i>opposition</i> (i, 24; v, 4). But it is not
conceivable to me that Thucydidês would have employed the words ἡ
ἐπανάστασις ὑπὸ τοῦ δήμου τοῖς δυνατοῖς—if the Demos had at that time
been actually in the government.
</p>
<p>
Again, viii, 63, he says, that the Athenian oligarchical party under
Peisander αὐτῶν τῶν Σαμίων προὐτρέψαντο τοὺς δυνατοὺς ὥστε πειρᾶσθαι
μετὰ σφῶν ὀλιγαρχηθῆναι, καίπερ <em class="gesperrt">ἐπαναστάντας αὐτοὺς ἀλλήλοις ἵνα
μὴ ὀλιγαρχῶνται</em>. Here the motive of the previous ἐπανάστασις
is clearly noted; it was in order that they might <i>not be under an
oligarchical government</i>: for I agree with Krüger (in opposition to
Dr. Thirlwall), that this is the clear meaning of the words, and
that the use of the present tense prevents our construing it, “in
order that their democratical government might not be subverted, and
an oligarchy put upon them,” which ought to be the sense, if Dr.
Thirlwall’s view were just.
</p>
<p>
Lastly,
<span class="replace" id="tn_2" title="In the printed book: vii, 73">viii, 73</span>,
we have οἱ γὰρ <em class="gesperrt">τότε τῶν Σαμίων ἐπαναστάντες τοῖς
δυνατοῖς καὶ ὄντες δῆμος, μεταβαλλόμενοι αὖθις</em>—ἐγένοντό τε ἐς
τριακοσίους ξυνωμόται, καὶ ἔμελλον τοῖς ἄλλοις <em class="gesperrt">ὡς δήμῳ ὄντι</em>
ἐπιθήσεσθαι. Surely these words—οἱ ἐπαναστάντες τοῖς δυνατοῖς καὶ
ὄντες δῆμος—“those who having risen in arms against the wealthy
and powerful, were now a demos, or a democracy,” must imply, <i>that
the persons against whom the rising had taken place had been a
governing oligarchy</i>. Surely, also, the words μεταβαλλόμενοι αὖθις,
can mean nothing else except to point out the strange antithesis
between the conduct of these same men at two different epochs not
far distant from each other. On the first occasion, they rose up
against an established oligarchical government, and constituted a
democratical government. On the second occasion, they rose up in
conspiracy against this very democratical government, in order to
subvert it, and constitute themselves an oligarchy in its place. If
we suppose that on the first occasion, the established government was
already democratical, and that the persons here mentioned were not
conspirators against an established oligarchy, but merely persons
making use of the powers of a democratical government to do violence
to rich citizens, all this antithesis completely vanishes.
</p>
<p>
On the whole, I feel satisfied that the government of Samos, at
the time when Chios revolted from Athens, was oligarchical, like
that of Chios itself. Nor do I see any difficulty in believing this
to be the fact, though I cannot state when and how the oligarchy
became established there. So long as the island performed its duty
as a subject ally, Athens did not interfere with the form of its
government. And she was least of all likely to interfere during
the seven years of peace intervening between the years 421-414
<small>B.C.</small> There was nothing then to excite her apprehensions.
The degree to which Athens intermeddled generally with the internal
affairs of her subject-allies, seems to me to have been much
exaggerated.
</p>
<p>
The Samian oligarchy, or geômori, dispossessed of the government on
this occasion, were restored by Lysander after his victorious close
of the Peloponnesian war,—Xenoph. Hellen. iii, 3, 6—where they are
called οἱ ἀρχαῖοι πολῖται.</p>

πάλιν κατὰ πόλεις καὶ ὁ <em class="gesperrt">ἀπὸ τῶν νεῶν πεζός</em>,
ὃς ἐπὶ τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον ἐμέλλησεν ἰέναι.</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold and Göller suppose that these soldiers had been
carried over to Lesbos to coöperate in detaching the island from
the Athenians. But this is not implied in the narrative. The
land-force <i>marched along</i> by land to Klazomenæ and Kymê (ὁ πεζὸς
ἅμα Πελοποννησίων τε τῶν παρόντων καὶ τῶν αὐτόθεν ξυμμάχων <em
class="gesperrt">παρῄει</em> ἐπὶ Κλαζομένων τε καὶ Κύμης). Thucydidês
does not say that they ever crossed to Lesbos: they remained near
Kymê, prepared to march forward, after that island should have been
conquered, to the Hellespont.</p>

<p>Haacke is right, I think, in referring the words ὁ ἀπὸ τῶν
νεῶν πεζός to what had been stated in c. 17; that Alkibiadês and
Chalkideus, on first arriving with the Peloponnesian five triremes
at Chios, disembarked on that island their Peloponnesian seamen
and armed them as hoplites for land-forces; taking aboard fresh
crews of seamen from the island. The motive to make this exchange
was, the great superiority of bravery, in heavy armor and stand-up
fighting, of Peloponnesians as compared with Chians or Asiatic Greeks
(see Xenoph. Hell. iii, 2, 17). These foot-soldiers taken from the
Peloponnesian ships are the same as those spoken of in c. 22: ὁ πεζὸς
ἅμα Πελοποννησίων τε τῶν παρόντων καὶ τῶν αὐτόθεν ξυμμάχων ... ὁ ἀπὸ
τῶν νεῶν πεζός.</p>

<p>Farther, these troops are again mentioned in c. 24, as οἱ μετὰ
Χαλκιδέως ἐλθόντες Πελοποννήσιοι, where Dr. Arnold again speaks
of them in his note incorrectly. He says: “The Peloponnesians who
came with Chalkideus must have been too few to offer any effectual
resistance to one thousand heavy-armed Athenians, being only <i>the
epibatæ</i> of five ships.” The fact is that they were not merely
the epibatæ, but the <i>entire crews</i>, of five ships; comprising
probably from eight hundred to one thousand men (ἐκ μὲν τῶν <em
class="gesperrt">ἐκ Πελοποννήσου νεῶν τοὺς ναύτας ὁπλίσαντες</em>
ἐν Χίῳ καταλιμπάνουσι, c. 17), since there were a remnant of five
hundred left of them, after some months’ operations and a serious
defeat (viii, 32).</p>

commander was afterwards displaced by the Athenians,—by the
recommendation of Peisander, at the time when this displacement
suited the purpose of the oligarchical conspirators,—on the charge of
having abandoned and betrayed Amorgês on this occasion, and caused
the capture of Iasus (Thucyd. viii, 54).</p>

<p>Phrynichus and his colleagues were certainly guilty of grave
omission in not sending notice to Amorgês of the sudden retirement of
the Athenian fleet from Milêtus, the ignorance of which circumstance
was one reason why Amorgês mistook the Peloponnesian ships for
Athenian.</p>

to make out. None of the commentators can explain the text without
admitting some alteration or omission of words: nor do any of the
explanations given appear to me convincing. On the whole, I incline

<p>That the Athenians should select Lesbos on this occasion as
the base of their operations, and as the immediate scene of last
preparations, against Chios,—was only repeating what they had once
done before (c. 24), and what they again did afterwards (c. 100). I
do not feel the difficulty which strikes Dobree and Dr. Thirlwall.

<p>The distinction here drawn between <i>the king’s territory</i>, and the

the court of Susa looked upon, together with all its inhabitants, as
a freehold exceedingly sacred and peculiar (Herodot. i, 4): by the
latter, as much as the satrap should find it convenient to lay hands

<p>We have to remark here, as on former occasions of revolts among
the dependent allies of Athens, that the general population of the
allied city manifests no previous discontent, nor any spontaneous
disposition to revolt. The powerful men of the island—those who, if
the government was democratical, formed the oligarchical minority,
but who formed the government itself, if oligarchical—conspire
and bring in the Peloponnesian force, unknown to the body of the
citizens, and thus leave to the latter no free choice. The real
feeling towards Athens on the part of the body of the citizens is one
of simple acquiescence, with little attachment on the one hand, yet
no hatred, or sense of practical suffering, on the other.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
